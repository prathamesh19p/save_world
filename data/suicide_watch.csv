###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

- Won’t ever need to worry about anything in my future because I won’t have one. Risking staying alive for the smallest chance of good things isn’t worth it.
- People can stop pretending to care about me
- Don’t have to worry about battling my weight. I’m like 145kg and refuse to exercise because I hate it so much. There isn’t anything that can convince me to do it.
- Don’t have to worry about being ugly anymore, I don’t need to appeal to a set beauty standard which would be ignorant for people to deny existed
- Don’t ever have to worry about being unhappy indefinitely&lt;/p&gt;

First post here, been reading posts here for a while now. First of all, I think that no one deserves to feel like absolute shit. (I’m typing this up while I have my daily 5 minutes of happiness and 5 minutes of actually being able to think about things properly) I’m only 13, my parents are not so nice I’ll just say that. They used to beat me, but now they just yell and blame shit on me. I feel like they’re taking advantage of my 3 year old brother, because he can’t call the police or do shit about it.

My parents often beat my brother, it’s kinda sad, and I’m not helping because I have anger issues (according to a “friend” at school I’m the rage monster or some shit) when my brother gets mad and stuff, I sometimes just can’t help myself and just yell at him. It’s a shit move, but at the time it seemed very reasonable, until 5 minutes later when I regret life decisions and convince myself that I’m a terrible human being. I just love having mood swings all the fucking time.

My very good parents also lock my brother in a room, make him stand against a wall and take a photo of it and post it to family and relatives, making a joke about it, but then my brother is being traumatized and fucking crying.

In the end, it wasn't serious. I had some signs of an overdose, but not the liver damage they thought they would see.

I hate having hope, only to be met with the same result. I know what to do, yet It feels like I can’t even steer myself into the right direction. I’m so misunderstood, and I don’t think I’ll ever be understood. There’s no point.&lt;/p&gt;

I've always had everything I needed to be happy. My family and I are super close. We've always travelled in and out of the country, have dinners in all the best places, play and have fun. My siblings and I treat each others like best friends. It's the kind of family you wish you had. I have genuine friends and a bunch of closest friends whom we treat each others as brothers and sisters. I grew up being loved by my peers because I've always been seen as bubbly, kind, and approachable. I'm famous in real life as well as in my social media. I have a bunch of people wanting to date me and I get who I want really. I get genuine compliments. I eat healthy, sleep healthy, and even go to the gym and read books. I make my own money and never really worry about it. I've experienced life the way it was meant to be experienced. I did some things that you could only see in movies or read in books.

I've had depression since 6 years ago. Been diagnosed for 3 years. I never really talked about it, in fact, this is the first time I think I'll be able to say things to a bunch of people. I did everything I could to alleviate what I was going through. I fought. It took a while but I was finally able to get help. It was fine for a moment but it's coming back even harder. I just don't think there's a point if it's always going to be like this. So I will be going. 

I hope I didn't sound boastful. Because trust me, I feel guilty for being the way I am when in reality I should be doing okay. I just wanted to be honest.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always had everything I needed to be happy. My family and I are super close. We&amp;#39;ve always travelled in and out of the country, have dinners in all the best places, play and have fun. My siblings and I treat each others like best friends. It&amp;#39;s the kind of family you wish you had. I have genuine friends and a bunch of closest friends whom we treat each others as brothers and sisters. I grew up being loved by my peers because I&amp;#39;ve always been seen as bubbly, kind, and approachable. I&amp;#39;m famous in real life as well as in my social media. I have a bunch of people wanting to date me and I get who I want really. I get genuine compliments. I eat healthy, sleep healthy, and even go to the gym and read books. I make my own money and never really worry about it. I&amp;#39;ve experienced life the way it was meant to be experienced. I did some things that you could only see in movies or read in books.

Just looking for advice or maybe someone to talk to. just honestly not sure what to do. This is gonna be a very loaded post and contains some uncomfortable content (you have been warned). Also I want to apologize in advance for any spelling or grammatical errors, as I have had quite a bit to drink while writing this.

you'll need a little back story first so here it is,

I'm male 28 years old now but this takes place over the course of my childhood. When I was an infant I had rolled down a flight of stairs in a walker shattered my arm and cracked open my skull. The injury to my skull was so bad it had to have surgery. The surgeons had to remove a small portion of my skull to release the pressure on my brain. I made a full recovery and proceeded to live my childhood out happily with no problems. or at least that's what I would like to say... The surgery did not go over well. in fact it couldn't have gone any worse. thankfully I made it out alive. however the portion of skull they removed never fully grew back due to the complications during the surgery. Due to this I was (and still am) not allowed to play sports or work any slightly dangerous jobs or the like. basically if its nothing short of a desk job/sitting down I'm not allowed to do it. (Please Note I only have doctors records to go off of so I apologize if any information is missing, obviously I was infant and didn't remember any of this and wasn't told) Please also note that this injury left me with a learning disability. Its not that I'm stupid or cant learn I just don't retain what I learn very well and sometimes not at all.

Naturally because I wasn't allowed to do most things children would do, I had no friends, The target of some of the worst bullying imaginable and to make it worse this also continued at home. At home it was the worst. My own mother was even a part of it. Saying things like ""your an idiot"", ""do you even try to use your brain"", ""why did I end up with a disabled son"", ""maybe you should have died during that surgery"". and so much more. this was a daily occurrence. My brothers, sisters, and even step parents (yes more than one as my mother was a habitual cheater and couldn't hold a relationship longer than a month or two). I was and still am miserable every day. I thought I could suffer thru all the mental abuse but everything changed when I turned 13. That year my mother decided since I was no longer a child that she could hit me. I was beaten everyday. by my mother, step father(s) ( I had about 10 throughout my childhood), my own siblings, and of course bullies at school. Now when I say beat I'm not talking about paddled over the ass with a wooden spoon or light punching/slapping. I'm talking my step father once beat me with a two by four (piece of wood for those who don't know what that is) till he cracked three of my ribs, Bruises the size of softballs, bloody noses, black eyes, getting hit with whatever was in grabbing distance till it broke, cruel and unusual punishment's, locking me in a room for over 24 hours by myself, screaming at me till they were red in the face calling me all kinds of unimaginable things, and that's only the tip of the iceberg. They even turned my other siblings on me. But the worst of all that happened, I was ""passionately hugged"" at the age of 13 by my step father at the time. my mother watched from the doorway and didnt do or say anything. I was being held down by someone three times my size and all my mother did was watch. she fucking watched as I screamed for help. FUCKING. WATCHED.

Something died in me that day and was never the same again. I completely shut down. no one was gonna help me. even if I told someone I thought there's no on way they would believe me. At this time In my life ages 13-17. I would go on and try to commit suicide a total of 4 times nearly succeeding on my 4th attempt. I talked to no one, closed myself away from everyone, tried to be away from home as much as possible anything and everything not to be there anymore. Stayed with my aunt whenever I could (which wasn't often as she traveled for work). I Finally moved out at the age of 18. Literally walked out the door at 12:01am with my mother screaming at me the whole way out about how im a god awful child and a waste of space and wishing me to fail at everything in life before I was able to drive away.

Please note I'm omitting a LOT of details that are just so hard to bring up right now. But I will answer any questions or clear any confusion up just ask.

Fast forward to today and why I'm writing this post. I have never gotten over any of this, haven't forgiven a single one of them and probably wont ever be able to. I just want to know do I need help? should I see someone to talk about this? should I go to a therapist? This is the first time in 15 years I have ever spoken about any of this, although I think about it every day, so this is the first time I have told this to anyone (even if its just online). I cant sleep/eat properly, my mind races a million miles an hour all the time with all kinds of unwanted thoughts, short/long term memory loss, wild mood swings, the complete inability to trust a single soul have a relationship or even date for that matter, lost all sense of taste/smell, none of the things I used to do for fun are enjoyable anymore, its like the world has gone grey and stale. its been this way for over a decade now and I'm breaking finally. I just cant take it anymore. I just don't know what to do. more and more everyday I just want my suffering to end. But I'm to scared to talk with people or go out in public. I just cant trust. I haven't gone out in society at any level since I was a 18 and I'm 28 now. all groceries are delivered to my front door, bills all paid online, my job I work completely alone and at night so I don't have to deal with customers. I have completely made my life with as little human contact as possible. I thought this would help but if anything this has only made things worse. The only thing that seems to have changed from moving out is I now have a non-consensual relationship with nicotine and liquor. I feel like I'm going crazy. any thoughts or suggestions? any help tips would be appreciated. I really don't know how to handle this as I wasn't taught anything useful as a child... and im sure people are gonna say it. But i wish this story was a joke. I wish with every fiber of my being it was all a lie. but its not. so please don't be unnecessarily cruel.

It took awhile to get to that point. The medical system isn't built for people who have trouble with keeping a schedule and managing stress.

Anyway, now I have a scheduled appointment on the books every two weeks.

It helps to talk to someone. I told her about this page and she advised me not to spend too much energy helping others because it can put unnecessary strain on myself to stay mentally balanced and people tend to take on the weight of the issues they are helping with.  Long story short, I haven't been on here a lot.

But there is something that bothers me about where I'm at. Every session at some point in the session the conversation stops and she turns to her computer then back at me and asks ""So how have the thoughts of suicide been.""

I cry.

It's hard that I have some example to tell her every time she asks. ""Oh well a couple days ago I thought about being dead but it wasn't that bad."" ""Last weekend I thought about how I would end it; but I know that I wouldn't actually do it.""

I feel like I'm reassuring her more than myself.

Yes I'm fine. No I won't kill myself. You've done your job. I'm safe.

She is a good therapist. I'm glad that she brings up things I don't always want to talk about. I'm just tired of having the thoughts.

I heard a song that made me think of my ex and I happened to be holding a pocket knife I just got today as a gift. I imagined what I could do with it.

When they’re not not in the forefront of my mind, they’ll creep up by the end of the day.

The idea frightens me, but at the same time i am seriously struggling to function. i’m crying every day, i’ve pushed all my friends away, and feel worthless and alone. i’m not taking care of myself, i’m falling behind in school and literally all i can do is sleep the pain away. i feel like my mind is holding me prisoner. i’ve reached out to suicide hotlines the past couple of nights but they didn’t really help. I feel like i need to reach out for medical help, but i’m worried of what my family will think and worried that it might make things worse. so i guess the point of all this is to ask if anyone else has sought inpatient treatment, what it did for you, and how you coped with leaving your responsibilities behind for a bit.

,SuicideWatch,"There's nothing in this world that can make me happy. I'm too broken. I've never been allowed to be happy, to be honest it was all probably doomed from the beginning, since the moment I took my first breath my life has been nothing but a punishment. My mind is a prison and so is this house, I have barely left it over the last year and this is what breaks me. I can't live with the pain of being myself, I deserve this after all. I know that in sitting here in my numbness feeling nothing but complete anguish, knowing that it's taking everything I got to write this, I know it's what I deserve. Why else would I be subject to this torment? I'm not a good person, I never have been. I'm a lying selfish bastard, I always have been... 

I keep trying my damn hardest and it's going nowhere, maybe I'm just not trying hard enough... maybe things are just hard because I don't deserve to have it easy, I don't deserve to be happy. I'm seeing a therapist and I've been trying to get a job (but I can't) I'm taking steps towards transitioning (I'm transgender) and I met the love of my life she's so perfect for me in every way but it's all just going nowhere. I see my therapist once a month and my antidepressants don't work all the time and I just keep having to wait and wait for transitioning and I live in a house where I can't be myself and I live in a world where people see me as a freak just for being who I am... I can't get an ID even though I'm 18 so I can't get a job and the person I love lives halfway across the world and my depression isn't fair to her since I know she can't fix something that's too broken and my pain does nothing but hurt her and it's isn't fair... Me being this way isn't fair to those who care but I just can't, I just can't hold on I can't do this anymore I don't know what to do I do nothing but spiral and my efforts go nowhere and if they do go somewhere it doesn't go very far and it takes a while to get there and I Just. Can't. Do this anymore... I need the strength to end it all right now but I'm too much of a coward. I can't get out of this house and I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. My mind has always been too broken, I don't function properly I don't remember things very well I'm not stable, I've never been stable. I can barely keep friendships and whenever I try to be a part of something, some group, anything, I make some mistake and I can't live with the shame and I can only ever think of how much they must find me annoying and how much they must not like me and how better it would be if I left... so I leave, and the process repeats. I always find myself somehow always going down the venting hole and that just makes me feel worse, I'm projecting my issues onto people I barely know and I know they can't fix it so what am I expecting to gain? I'm probably just some shitty attention whore and I need to learn to not be one. I need to keep punishing myself until one day I learn how to act like a normal person. Even if I don't leave said group after making the mistake of venting I know everyone will just get tired of me venting, it's happened before so it'll happen again. I also leave so that there isn't the opportunity for anyone to get tired of my constant depression and venting and ranting and blah blah it never ends... There's too much wrong with me to even begin to explain and even if I tried it wouldn't work because I don't know how. It's always problem after problem, there's too much to keep track of anymore. Everything just piles up until I can't take it anymore and then one little thing happens and I snap and everyone thinks I'm flipping out over this one little thing but no-one understands. No-one ever understands... I've lived my whole life being misunderstood and pushed to the side and treated like a child because I'm autistic. I've lived a life of trying to be who my parents want me to be and I can't take it anymore. Sure my step-father isn't in the picture anymore and my biological father may as well never exist, but he still had an impact on me. He instilled that toxic masculinity that made it so hard to accept myself as a trans woman. That's only the tip of the iceberg though. And then there's my mother, where everything I do is just never good enough. Always assuming and all that, blaming all my problems on my computer and my phone because that's what's easy. Always complaining how messy the house is when she doesn't even clean up after herself. Treating my depression like I'm just in a bad mood or some shit like that. I don't think I'll ever forget the day where I had a self-hate spiral and I was crying and as she left for work she told me ""don't forget to do the dishes today."" I know she doesn't care. Just a bit ago I was in my bed, barely moving because my depression has been hitting me so hard it is difficult to move. Granted, she didn't see that I was crying but she still just acted like I was choosing to act like a little twat... She'll never care. She's nice as long as I'm her 'good little boy' that does everything she says. I know she thinks I'm just a feminine man, she's even told me it before. She's told me that I will never be a real woman, and yet she pretends to be accepting sometimes. It's to the point where I do everything I can to avoid arguing with her. All arguments with her ends the same, with her telling me how much she sacrificed to be a good mother to me and my sister and/or she takes something away from me. I'm always hearing how *good* of a mother she was but from what I remember she didn't do a very good job. Sure she had her moments, she still does, but I will always remember how she would just sit outside and smoke all day while my sister tormented me and treated me like subhuman trash and blackmailed me to do what she wanted, nothing was mine and everything was hers. I know she feels bad for how she was and I know she's tried to get better but it doesn't change the past, it doesn't change how she treated me. Back to my mother, her go-to punishment is to take things away from me and I know the next time that happens she'll take away the internet or just my computer as a whole and I can't let that happen. Right now my connection to my girlfriend and the friends I do have is what's keeping me together right now. It's been what's kept me together since covid hit... And yeah I know I'm an adult and her taking those things from me would amount to taking my property but the truth is I'm too scared to stand up to her. The last time I did that I ended up sleeping on the floor and being locked out of my room until I complied... I remember that night. I was 16 and I was in a relationship she didn't approve of, and I did something that I don't remember what it was, probably argued with her about the relationship. All the time I would hear from my mother and sister how much they didn't like who I was with and how much of a ""unstable piece of shit"" my partner was... As you can imagine it got on my nerves rather quickly. That night in particular, she was going to take my phone away but I was terrified of her finding a way to get into it and going through my personal messages *because she has before.* She denies it but I know it happened. I remember being in middle school and my sister would take my ipod all the time to text her boyfriend and her other friends and well, me being the curious 6th grader that I was, I had tried to seek out porn in creative ways due to the parental lock. When my mother found out about my sister's relationship with that guy she went through the ipod knowing that she would use it all the time. And well, she found out that I had been trying to look for said material and was furious. She gave my sister and I a big long lecture about how her trust in us was broken and for a while after that we were barely allowed to do anything and she had set up something to record us while she was at work... But I'm getting off topic again. That night I refused to give her my phone ended rather poorly. I had a feeling she'd try to take it so I hid it from her in my room so she locked me out of my room until I decided I was going to give it up. I was pissed, as you can imagine. I don't quite remember what happened after that since I probably blocked it out but I remember standing outside in the backyard porch area in the cold crying because I was so upset. I remember when I finally came back inside she told me what I could sleep in the spare room/office since I wasn't allowed in my room. I slept on a mattress on the floor that was too small for me and I cried myself to sleep...

I don't even remember what the original point of saying all that was, but here I am. I know I can't get out of this house and I just want to fucking die, I see no way out of this. I can't hold on any longer I met my limit a long time ago... Maybe I won't end myself today but I can't see myself lasting very long.

Always assuming and all that, blaming all my problems on my computer and my phone because that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s easy. Always complaining how messy the house is when she doesn&amp;#39;t even clean up after herself. Treating my depression like I&amp;#39;m just in a bad mood or some shit like that. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll ever forget the day where I had a self-hate spiral and I was crying and as she left for work she told me &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t forget to do the dishes today.&amp;quot; I know she doesn&amp;#39;t care. Just a bit ago I was in my bed, barely moving because my depression has been hitting me so hard it is difficult to move. Granted, she didn&amp;#39;t see that I was crying but she still just acted like I was choosing to act like a little twat... She&amp;#39;ll never care. She&amp;#39;s nice as long as I&amp;#39;m her &amp;#39;good little boy&amp;#39; that does everything she says. I know she thinks I&amp;#39;m just a feminine man, she&amp;#39;s even told me it before. She&amp;#39;s told me that I will never be a real woman, and yet she pretends to be accepting sometimes. It&amp;#39;s to the point where I do everything I can to avoid arguing with her. All arguments with her ends the same, with her telling me how much she sacrificed to be a good mother to me and my sister and/or she takes something away from me. I&amp;#39;m always hearing how &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; of a mother she was but from what I remember she didn&amp;#39;t do a very good job. Sure she had her moments, she still does, but I will always remember how she would just sit outside and smoke all day while my sister tormented me and treated me like subhuman trash and blackmailed me to do what she wanted, nothing was mine and everything was hers. I know she feels bad for how she was and I know she&amp;#39;s tried to get better but it doesn&amp;#39;t change the past, it doesn&amp;#39;t change how she treated me. Back to my mother, her go-to punishment is to take things away from me and I know the next time that happens she&amp;#39;ll take away the internet or just my computer as a whole and I can&amp;#39;t let that happen. Right now my connection to my girlfriend and the friends I do have is what&amp;#39;s keeping me together right now. It&amp;#39;s been what&amp;#39;s kept me together since covid hit... And yeah I know I&amp;#39;m an adult and her taking those things from me would amount to taking my property but the truth is I&amp;#39;m too scared to stand up to her. The last time I did that I ended up sleeping on the floor and being locked out of my room until I complied... I remember that night. I was 16 and I was in a relationship she didn&amp;#39;t approve of, and I did something that I don&amp;#39;t remember what it was, probably argued with her about the relationship. All the time I would hear from my mother and sister how much they didn&amp;#39;t like who I was with and how much of a &amp;quot;unstable piece of shit&amp;quot; my partner was... As you can imagine it got on my nerves rather quickly. That night in particular, she was going to take my phone away but I was terrified of her finding a way to get into it and going through my personal messages &lt;em&gt;because she has before.&lt;/em&gt; She denies it but I know it happened. I remember being in middle school and my sister would take my ipod all the time to text her boyfriend and her other friends and well, me being the curious 6th grader that I was, I had tried to seek out porn in creative ways due to the parental lock. When my mother found out about my sister&amp;#39;s relationship with that guy she went through the ipod knowing that she would use it all the time. And well, she found out that I had been trying to look for said material and was furious. She gave my sister and I a big long lecture about how her trust in us was broken and for a while after that we were barely allowed to do anything and she had set up something to record us while she was at work... But I&amp;#39;m getting off topic again. That night I refused to give her my phone ended rather poorly. I had a feeling she&amp;#39;d try to take it so I hid it from her in my room so she locked me out of my room until I decided I was going to give it up. I was pissed, as you can imagine. I don&amp;#39;t quite remember what happened after that since I probably blocked it out but I remember standing outside in the backyard porch area in the cold crying because I was so upset. I remember when I finally came back inside she told me what I could sleep in the spare room/office since I wasn&amp;#39;t allowed in my room. I slept on a mattress on the floor that was too small for me and I cried myself to sleep...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even remember what the original point of saying all that was, but here I am. I know I can&amp;#39;t get out of this house and I just want to fucking die, I see no way out of this. I can&amp;#39;t hold on any longer I met my limit a long time ago... Maybe I won&amp;#39;t end myself today but I can&amp;#39;t see myself lasting very long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I feel like I'm on autopilot every day

If I were to describe how I'm feeling, I would say... fuzzy? My head feels fuzzy.

Nothing bad has happened to me and i dont feel terrible. I just feel numb i think, I'm not even sure. I dont want to experience anything life has to offer. I don't want to graduate, I don't want a girlfriend, I don't want to get my own place to live, I don't want kids and I dont want a job. I feel so stupid with how I feel because I don't have a reason.

Life just feels so mundane every day. It's the same thing, every day, every week, every month, every year. I'm so bored with whatever I do. I have no joy.

I feel alone because all I hear from other people is that they feel so terribly sad and miserable when they're depressed. For me the reality is that I'm never really sad or happy. I feel nothing most of the time. When I am happy, i feel weird because... I dont know? I dont feel comfortable feeling happy and I can't help but feel comfortable whenever I'm slipping into another episode.

I used to suffer from severe anxiety, and that made me want to kill myself. Since taking meds, I don't feel it. I dont fucking KNOW how I feel and I'm just talking myself in circles here because I can't describe it.

I dont want anything. Life, death, anything. I dont want to try kill myself because I feel like that'll take too much effort to do right. I simply want to not exist, but even then that doesn't seem right to me. nothing seems right to me. Trying to explain everything makes my head feel weird.

Idk what to do, I told my parents multiple times that I really don’t want to go there but hey don’t give a fuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and I have tried using other things to distract myself but the problem is that I get bored rly easily and my mind starts wandering unless it’s a constant stream of smth, like a video for example &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;rn the plan is to go through before I turn 18. I genuinely can’t see a future for myself after high school so let’s hope that happens&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been choking myself recently just to get the lightheaded feeling, it’s nice but I also 
I feel like a dick bc and I haven’t cut or starved myself today so I feel even worse fuck this&lt;/p&gt;

lost them too before all this i had a gf who i found out was sitting on a bench and kissed one of my friends RW  in a drunk angry mood i told her she can have him and gave him my phone and told him the same what i didnt expect was that they actually would begin a relation that very moment over my phone i never heard from her or him since  i fuck everything up i dont have a job i dont feel happy since the last year and a half the only thing im good at is making other people happy and fix their problems but i cant seem to fix  my own or make myself happy so now for the past year and a half im thinking of ending it in great detail in my mind and on some days i daydream or dream that i kill my entire family and in detail even my bany sister who just turned 2 years old today was her party and on this day i woke up to a text of my gf we are together for  2 weeks the text said ye i want to be friends i just cant have a relationship with you but dont worry we are still friends a few minutes ago i kept texting her i dont want this to end i am now blocked on all platforms snap facebook insta she was the only one i had left i met her e few weeks after losing my friends we have been texting ever since we both wanted to try more and we were happy she was too indont understand why it ended like this thursday inwant to her place there was not a single que that she didnt love me anymore we hugged we kissed she even got a little horny at the end of the day we didnt do anything but she sure wanted to and me too but we couldnt cuz she wanted to wait a little longer cuz our relation was only 2 weeks old i went home and she texted me weirdly friday she didnt text me at all until 9 pm  and still weirdly also i was busy helping my dad at 9 until 11 pm and yesterday same story didnt hear her until 9 pm a few texts and thats it and today i woke up to a break up text like i said before she was the only person left and i was happy with her i instantly saw myself cutting my wrist in the bathtub after that i saw myself stepping outside wait for a truck and jump headfirst under one ofe the wheels i finally understand now that everything i love runs away from me i finally understand i dont deserve to be happy i see myself hanging jumping off a bridge all these thing i see in full HD every detail my head splattering as i get run over by a truck my body splatting on the floor blood all over the concrete after i jump of a bridge my wrists getting sliced open and then me struggeling to cut my other wrist everything so detailed and then what comes after me in peace no more failures no more stupid mistakes just me in a void not happy but not sad or sometimes i see myself happy on a sunny beach nice white sand lovely bleu sea nice breeze of wind and finally happy all my friends

month and 1 week for it to go all to hell and i lost them too before all this i had a gf who i found out was sitting on a bench and kissed one of my friends RW  in a drunk angry mood i told her she can have him and gave him my phone and told him the same what i didnt expect was that they actually would begin a relation that very moment over my phone i never heard from her or him since  i fuck everything up i dont have a job i dont feel happy since the last year and a half the only thing im good at is making other people happy and fix their problems but i cant seem to fix  my own or make myself happy so now for the past year and a half im thinking of ending it in great detail in my mind and on some days i daydream or dream that i kill my entire family and in detail even my bany sister who just turned 2 years old today was her party and on this day i woke up to a text of my gf we are together for  2 weeks the text said ye i want to be friends i just cant have a relationship with you but dont worry we are still friends a few minutes ago i kept texting her i dont want this to end i am now blocked on all platforms snap facebook insta she was the only one i had left i met her e few weeks after losing my friends we have been texting ever since we both wanted to try more and we were happy she was too indont understand why it ended like this thursday inwant to her place there was not a single que that she didnt love me anymore we hugged we kissed she even got a little horny at the end of the day we didnt do anything but she sure wanted to and me too but we couldnt cuz she wanted to wait a little longer cuz our relation was only 2 weeks old i went home and she texted me weirdly friday she didnt text me at all until 9 pm  and still weirdly also i was busy helping my dad at 9 until 11 pm and yesterday same story didnt hear her until 9 pm a few texts and thats it and today i woke up to a break up text like i said before she was the only person left and i was happy with her i instantly saw myself cutting my wrist in the bathtub after that i saw myself stepping outside wait for a truck and jump headfirst under one ofe the wheels i finally understand now that everything i love runs away from me i finally understand i dont deserve to be happy i see myself hanging jumping off a bridge all these thing i see in full HD every detail my head splattering as i get run over by a truck my body splatting on the floor blood all over the concrete after i jump of a bridge my wrists getting sliced open and then me struggeling to cut my other wrist everything so detailed and then what comes after me in peace no more failures no more stupid mistakes just me in a void not happy but not sad or sometimes i see myself happy on a sunny beach nice white sand lovely bleu sea nice breeze of wind and finally happy all my friends there too but finally at peace&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"about 2 months ago I was in my car driving to the edge of a cliff that's well known in my town for the fact that 6 people (and a dog?) have committed suicide by jumping off of. Before I could, I got a few calls in the car, and ended up going to a mental health Rehabilitation facility instead. it was nice there but it felt like I was in a cage and I ended up leaving my program early.

i went into PHP and everything was going alright, ups and downs of course but generally, I felt like I was getting better. I went back to work at my part-time job i literally couldn't afford not to go back to. its at a movie theater and cleaning up after the hedonistic slobs that leave their shit in the theater didn't help me.

I'm also a pot smoker, up until lately because now i don't have two nickels to rub together. so the thing that i was using to numb the pain is outside of my reach (i cant drink) and i feel shitty asking to use other people's supply.

it feels like the only people who would notice if i killed myself are my boyfriend and my dog. and even with them, i can never fully enjoy my time because of the major depressive disorder and anxiety, I'm medicated and it helps a bit but i feel like I'm the problem. I feel like I'm dragging down my boys mood constantly and making him support me more than any reasonable partner should.

talking to people doesnt help me, my automatic defenses kick in of feeling like a burden and so i pretend everything is alright. im really good at pretending now.

I tried to plan ahead for the future to give myself something to hold on to, but everywhere i go to apply for college loans would rather i do kill myself than give me a loan without a cosigner. and the people who i would ask to cosign are to busy being as actively neglectful as they have been for the last 20 years.

,SuicideWatch,"Dear SuicideWatch,

It's been about a year since I first started experiencing suicidal thoughts. It all happened really quickly and I didn't know how to process it. I decided to come here to r/SuicideWatch to speak my mind, in the hope that I could get an answer about how to move forwards without taking my life. Even though I didn't know anyone who replied, I remember finding it really difficult to make this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hlvtx6/justice/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hlvtx6/justice/) 

I know it sounds cliché, but speaking to someone about how you feel can really help out. It allows you to gain some perspective from another person. More importantly, it prevents you from keeping your difficult thoughts to yourself. I think loneliness/solitude can really make dealing with suicidal thoughts unbearable. Having just one person that you can confide in can truly do wonders. I'm a bit of a mess making this post right now, so I'm sorry that the structure is a bit all over the place. 

I still have suicidal thoughts now. However, they get to me much less often than they did a year ago. I've figured out ways to tolerate them and not overthink them too much. Oftentimes, we don't completely move past grief, but we grow around it. I can't forget my thoughts, but I can handle them a lot better now. It can get better. I can't guarantee that it will, but it can. 

I started helping out here on r/SuicideWatch. I know it sounds very dramatic, but I mainly did it to ease my conscious. I talked about it a bit on the linked post, but I did something terrible to someone when I was younger. Processing this led me down a really bleak moment in my life. Everything seemed hopeless. I couldn't see myself moving forwards. I felt like I was deceiving everyone around me. It was almost unbearable. 

I can't say that it got better straight away, if anything it got worse. I broke down a lot initially. Mostly in secret, as I didn't want to disturb anyone. If you're trying to get over something, giving yourself time to grieve and breakdown is so important. Without doing this, you're harbouring thoughts that can be really draining on you in the long term. It all peaked for me around this time last year. I don't think it got worse past early August.

I continued to help out here in order to earn my redemption. However, the more I reached out to people who had posted, the more my reasoning for helping out changed. I was initially trying to redeem myself through my actions, but I saw a fantastic quote that gave me a lot of clarity.  “A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward.”― **George R.R. Martin**  Any good act I do isn't cancelled out by my past, but it's important to appreciate that any bad in my past isn't washed out by any good either. 

It gave me a healthier outlook on redemption. I no longer had this massive ""redemption debt"" that I had to pay back with good deeds. My new road to redemption simply involves trying to do what's right wherever I can. This involved publicly speaking up about my mental health at one point. I know there's a lot of stigma surrounding this, but I felt like I had a responsibility to challenge said stigma. If there was a single person in my circle who needed to hear what I had to say, then I didn't mind making myself all vulnerable on social media. However, this made me break down again, as it was really difficult opening up like that to so many people.

From that point onwards, I've mostly been okay. There have been days where I've really, really struggled, but these were mostly isolated incidents. ""Time heals all wounds"", so they say. I'm not sure how true this quote is, but it seems to be true for my suicidal thoughts. This is just my opinion, but it slowly gets better. I wish I could promise this, but I don't want to make empty promises to anybody.

I still need to apologise to the person that I hurt, but I haven't worked up the courage to do that just yet. I still have a long way to go on my road to redemption, but I'm getting closer to where I need to be. The reason why I wanted to share my thoughts today was because I wish I heard from someone who was in a similar position to me this time last year. If you're struggling with your past and you need someone to talk to, please drop a comment down below. 

I'm going to bed now, but if this post helps just one person who has gone through something similar, then I'm happy. I can also provide more redemption advice.

,SuicideWatch,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 16 months. I think we moved too fast. She’s my first girlfriend and my love for her is genuine. I think we got wrapped up in how right the relationship felt and jumped the gun on moving in together. We’ve been living together for nearly a year. I sacrificed a really comfortable living situation with my best friend to move in with her. He has since taken a new roommate and there is no room for me to return. 

Over the past year though, fighting has become more and more common, to the point where I am genuinely questioning if I made the right call with her. I just feel like everything I do is wrong. We bit off a hair more than we could chew with our rent situation as we were in a rush to move after we got robbed at our old place. So every now and again I must take some extra shifts at work to ensure I can make my half of the bills. It’s not that financially strained, but the extra shifts are a necessary evil. This causes fights between us. There’s a lot of double standards in this relationship. She is free to spend her time as she pleases, but if I want to take an extra shift, it’s a whole thing. Trying to communicate my feelings with her results in a fight. She says I don’t listen to her feelings. I try, but whenever she has a grievance with me, it can’t just be a talk, it’s gotta jump straight into a fight. One where I’m always made to be the bad guy. She insists that she misses me and wants to spend time with me, but when we have time to spend together, she will find the first opportunity to get mad at me. 

I’m just so confused. I do love her. But I don’t love always being made to feel I’m in the wrong. I don’t love the double standards, and I don’t love always having to walk to the beat of her drum. I want this to work. I genuinely feel that when things are good, they outweigh the bad. I try to show my love in various ways. She comes home to a clean house most days, I treat her to dinner and the like fairly often, and I sometimes get her random little gifts. She insists I don’t support her, but I feel I do. Maybe our definitions of support are different. But I feel the break-up coming. In her mind, this is who I am: the selfish asshole.

Today’s fight consisted of me telling her I’d need to work tomorrow. That blew up and became a bigger fight about who supports who, pulling weight around the house, and a bunch of other stupid shit. We were to go to a party today and she ended up going without me, basically leaving me to my thoughts. 

So that alone isn’t reason enough to consider suicide. But if this break-up happens, I am screwed. I don’t make enough to feasibly live by myself in a location that works with my job and school with enough space for myself and my two cats. I certainly can’t afford this place by myself, and as I mentioned, returning to my living situation with my best friend is no longer an option. I should stress that this financial worry is not my primary reason for wanting to avoid a break-up. I genuinely love my girlfriend and would do mostly anything for her. It’s just that we’re this to occur, it would be cataclysmic for me. I’m so close to finishing my degree, but I would have to shelve it if I had to live by myself. It would just be such a waste. I’ve held a 4.0 the entire time I’ve been in school. My hard work was finally going to pay off, but it’s seeming like a distinct possibility that my academic career will be on hiatus soon.

I was suicidal for years, but I started this medication to treat my symptoms for depression and possible BPD (?) that honestly I feel heightened everything I felt. I truly did not have a happy moment anymore, and was incredibly manic. I felt insane. 

I went on a trip to see my friends from online, this was huge for me because they are such a loving and caring group of people that Im so lucky to have met.. But even on the trip, I had my moments where I would cry and isolate myself.

One day while I was with them, they all went into the store to get some food for the camping trip we were gonna go on. I decided to stay in the car, alone, because I was just not having it. Eventually.. My impulses became too strong. I did not think about ANYTHING. My mind was telling me to take as many of my pills I could, don’t care about the consequences, just do it.

(Im not 100% sure if my intention was suicide or to just get a high, regardless it was fucking stupid.)

They kicked in when we arrived at the campgrounds, and everyone had to watch me be barely conscious, falling, vomitting..

They took me to the hospital and 2 of them stayed with me until my mom came, I love them so much and they hold no judgements.

I could’ve died if I took only a few more.

After this experience, I really want and HAVE to change. I view almost everything positively and I refuse to fall back down again. 

The issue is, nearly everyone around me just doesn’t see ME anymore. They see a fragile, mentally ill girl who tried to kill herself in front of her friends.


I dont want to say I hate myself but, I absolutely despise that person I was and feel strongly that it had to do with the medication I was on (effexor). Two of my newly made friends think Im unstable and dont even wanna be around me anymore, my  other friends’s families are not comfortable around me, and I just feel like I cannot escape that old me. 


Ive wasted everything before I could even experience it.


Im writing this to shed some light onto this issue because Im sure its common, and its for those who are struggling with the same issue. What I did, mediccational or not, was vile and disturbing for everyone and Id give everything I have to go back and prevent it. Even f you feel no one cares, just know its false and you wiuld be surprised by how many people love and care for your existence. Appreciate yourself and others more, trust me, you can lose it all so easily and sit with that loss.. Its the worst feeling possible.

,SuicideWatch,"
Let me preface by saying that I’m only 14, turning 15 in august. let’s just say the people I grew up around fucked me up and so did (do) my current friends. The city that I live in, in the third world country known as the United States really doesn’t help either (cheap drugs, poverty, extremely depressing overall, a lot of people start using at my age) But really only have myself to blame

When I was 11, I was introduced to weed by my brother. I loved it and became a daily smoker at that age. Not long after, I was introduced to shrooms.

Again, loved it and a year later, at age 12 I tried acid for the first time. I fell in love with psychedelics and took acid/shrooms almost monthly for a while. 
Took a break from psychedelics and weed after it caused hefty derealization.

Only a week ago, my ex girlfriend (15) who has recently become a massive coke addict, invited me over to do coke with her. I was hesitant about it but I wanted to see what it’s like. We binged about .5 that night, no euphoria, barely even more intense than a couple cups of coffee, loved the drip however. 

Extremely boring and pointless feeling, but every 10 minutes all I wanted was another line. Ended up having unprotected sex as I had zero inhibition which risks aside, made me feel like a total piece of shit as I’m currently in a very happy relationship with my girlfriend (16) and have been for 9 months.

When the comedown hit, I felt an overwhelming wave of shame, along with wanting more coke. Lied to her and told her I missed a dose of my meds and went home because i was so ashamed of myself

I spent the entirety of the next day sucking the coke residue off the post it notes that we used to snort it with. Promised myself I’d never do it again and felt like a total piece of shit, was kind of using the leftover coke to combat the shame I was feeling. Also freaked the fuck out about pregnancy and bought an ec pill for her, which she refused to take. 

I forgot about coke until yesterday when she texted me asking to come do more coke. I was reminded of what I felt on it (albeit barely anything at all) and accepted. 

Gave her $50 for coke, which was all the money I had, which I was saving for a new guitar pedal. Guess what? Same exact thing happened. The exact same thing I promised I’d never do again. We did about half the bag and again realized what I had done.

I went home which she literally begged me not to do, but I just couldn’t fucking stay there, it was less about the coke but more about the fact that I was with her, someone who I promised myself I would cut out of my life and once again cheated on my fucking girlfriend. It’s currently 4am and I’ve spent the whole night sucking on the post it notes and snorting random white specks off my clothes. 

I left the bag at her house and she’s asking me to hang out tomorrow to finish off the bag and I really don’t know if I have the willpower to decline it. 

These are the only two times I’ve done coke, I had no idea how horrible this drug is. Is my life already ruined? These are the only two times I’ve done this, but am I already captured? Did I fuck everything up?

What the fuck do I do? As I’m writing this I am having a full blown panic attack, can’t stop thinking about how I cheated on my girlfriend, wanting more coke, worrying that I got her pregnant and wondering if I’m already fucked. I don’t think I’m full on addicted yet, so there may still be time. I am a pretty promising musician, released a couple albums that people like and get decent grades. I literally don’t know how I can carry on, what am I going to do?

I posted this to a sub for quitting coke but I was shamed and mocked.

I don't eat and sleep properly, I have many psysical pains, I forgot what us like to sit in your room and just surf to a pc, read a book or watch a movie. Everyday I just sleep, wake up, eat something and go out for walking and stay outside from house. Then I stay in my moms car for 2-3 hours, come home and lay on bed. I can't find a job, go to a doctor or do anything else because of this. Everyday I just think how to end my life.

This just the result of my awful life. I have struggle with so many things and never thought it can go deeper but guess I was wrong. There is not a day that I didn't think that this is my last one I just dekay the inevitable. Between ptsd and depersonalization there us no way to come back in real life as a normal person and I refuse to take again medication and go to fucking therapists. They damaged me enough for 8 years.

This is not a life. Nobody can't live this way. Just because I have a home and parents who give me money and I sleep and eat it doesn't mean that I'm better than others. Everyday is a living nightmare. The only person I talk to is my mother but she is useless she can't do anything to stop me or say something helpful it's too late. And I just become violent towards her everytime I remember something from the past.

I can't understand what I expect. A miracle probably but there is no way to get out of it. I waste my time with reddit and youtube and trying to predict the future but I can't last anymore. There is no point to tell everything that is going wrong with me and how much I torture and neglect myself, the result is the same. I'm not dead inside yet but I don't feel alive.

I want someone to come late at night in this fucking car, take my hand, tell me how worthy I'm and help me to go to my house without panicking. I wish my mom to do that but she is afraid of me so she can't help me anymore.

I keep thinking that all of these generations managed to be normal, until it reached me and I&amp;#39;m a freak who can&amp;#39;t do anything. All I wanted was to be happy and have a family of my own but I&amp;#39;m trans and now it&amp;#39;s too late to do anything about it. I feel terrible that my parents are watching their peers with their normal adult children why I seem to be mentally stuck at 15. I went to therapy for a couple of years and it only made me better at hiding my feelings and just delayed this meltdown I&amp;#39;m having. I don&amp;#39;t have a moment of enjoyment, all of these worries are going on 24/7 in my mind and its turning me crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope there&amp;#39;s something more after death.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Hello, I am 15 (M) and my sleep is all sorts of fucked up. I've asked my mom to take me to the doctor over this because its been over a month and a half since I've had good sleep but she really just doesn't give a fuck about me. I would have to break a arm before she would even think about taking me to the doctor, she thinks she knows everything when she doesn't. Melatonin seems to have the opposite effect, it makes it easier to fall asleep but I wake up every hour or so which means I am getting somewhere around half of the sleep I should be. 

I just want to have 1 good night of sleep and I don't know how much longer I can put up with this before I just hang myself, this shit is just making me lose it all. I can't concentrate, I am just constantly zoned out in my thoughts of offing myself, constant headaches, my mind feels foggy this is just the worst. Even when I get sleep I wake up unrested. I've lost all interests in the things that I used to like and this just feels like hell.

I have 7 siblings, 4 of which are currently living in the same house as us so its very hard for me to want to talk about emotional problems with my mom because that is a lot of vulnerability even if its my siblings I don't think I can take being judged for my emotions. I've put a front of being this joking, happy 15 year old but in the inside I am just a complete fucking mess, extremely insecure about my height, face, voice basically everything. Which really isn't helping me in the whole not wanting to die department. If I were to off myself I wouldn't care how my siblings would feel only my mother, my sibling are constant assholes to me but my mom is obviously my mom so I don't know.

Self harm is something I'm deeply ashamed about and its not helping that I have to wear a coat in 90 degree weather constantly which just makes me want to die more while I wait for cuts to heal to the point where they are unnoticeable. My mom keeps all of her knives locked up so I have to use this small razor, Which thank god for by the way. I just am not thinking straight when im in the mindset of wanting to self harm and several times I am searching for something more sharp so I can cut deeper. 

Its gotten so bad recently, I wouldn't mind if someone shot me in the face or ran me over. Turning 16 soon so I guess that's cool but I just wanna die if I'm being honest. It wouldn't be murder it would be a mercy kill. I would rather die then feel this pain inside that I can't show on the outside. No ambition or purpose or anything just living to live, constantly waiting for it to get better and it gets worse always. Can someone just tell me otherwise? I mean life is pretty cool on paper but I don't know how much more of this I can take before I just off myself. Ive never had any form of validation while growing up, no support, my dad is a complete asshole that left my life a long time ago but he made sure to fuck up my head before he left. Even with my family being religious I'm not even scared of hell, mainly because I just think its all horseshit because why would someone bring me here just to suffer?

I was diagnosed with Boarder line personality disorder two years ago (on top of depression and major anxiety) after an almost two year court battle (still waiting to testify which is coming this march; might as well add my mother, who was married to this man, who disowned me for almost two years and still talks to him and pays for his lawyer) with my step father who sexually assaulted me from the age of 9 to almost 14, until I cut my hair to look like a boy so he would leave me alone. 

I had a regression dream that it would happen to my daughters so I stood my ground and pushed them out of my life, which I feel is justified. I saved my girls from a monster.

,SuicideWatch,"It's been almost a decade that I've been putting this off, out of love and respect for my Grandmother, but I can't do it anymore, I can't be a part of this charade any longer.   


Nobody really gives a shit about me. My life was ruined by those around me, and worse, I did nothing to lift myself up. Feeling lost my whole life, alone, and in constant fear.   


When I was a little boy, my parents fought very often. My father was an alcoholic, and my mother wasn't satisfied with him, she wanted a life of luxury. They got divorced. I've been told that my mother didn't even want to have me, but I didn't believe any of them, as I've loved my mother and hated my father. The day comes when I have to make the choice in court with whom to stay, my mother tells me that life would be hars with her, I should do whatever I want. The intent in her voice clearly said she didn't want me. I was mortified. My whole childhood flashed before me, and I saw my mother, I saw the truth, she was never actually there. Most of her free time she'd go out to cheat on my father hoping she'd hook a bigger fish, and leave me home with a can of food.  
 My father's turn comes, it was all scripted, he said you make your own choice, but I knew he didn't want me, he even said to my family that I should go with my mother, but they guilted him into taking me. Not because they cared about me, but because it would be a bad image for the family. I had no choice but to go with him, it's in his house that I grew up.   


I've been told growing up that I was a smart kid. But nobody wanted to help me. I was lost, I felt alone, confused. Couldn't focus on studying, struggling. Nothing came out of it. Other members of the family hated me, even openly. The thought that I was better than their own kid ticked them off, said I did nothing to deserve it and only cheated.   


My cousin (she) hated me the most, but for a different reason. For being my mother's son. My mother envied her for being prettier, better at hooking old rich guys, and called her a whore, after she told my father that my mother was cheating on him. Having an explosive personality and a short fuse, it immediately turned violent, physical. This was the fight that started the divorce. My life was a living hell because of my cousin. She hated my guts. Every time she'd come in town she'd yell at me, threaten me with physical violence and forced me to follow her and do her chores. When I was 17 or so, this only got worse. She threatened to throw me out of the house, to go homeless if I didn't work for my family's company. I had no choice, too horrified to tell anyone. The hours were excruciating, and while I wasn't laying bricks, the work was still hard and the pay was dogshit. I develop an illness, most likely from the fear, depression and anxiety (since the bacteria that normally causes this was ruled out) and she could no longer force me to come. I had to get treatment. I tried confining in my family what she had done to me at this point, hinting for a long time about it, but none of them believed me. They brushed me off.   


I never felt so betrayed.    


School finished, and I'm without a job for almost a decade. Crippled with anxiety, useless, with nothing to offer. A parasite, but a very low maintenance parasite that they can use, which is why I wasn't yet discarded. Never once in my life had they asked for my consent on responsibilities they wanted to shove down my throat. Forced to take care of their kittens, since they wanted cats. Love them dearly, the animals have no fault of their own, and have grown out to be the most beautiful cats our family ever had, but I despise that I have no choice.   


My father ? Well my father only got worse, alcoholism then and now, he's way worse. Threatened to kill me multiple times, even heard him taking this year of driving the car with me and killing the both of us.    


At this point I'm too tired to even flesh everything out.   


I'm a 27 year old virgin, I regret missing out on the most fun years of my life. Now at my age, most people are settling down. I missed out on everything. I've hated my own body for my whole life, but I think a lot about sex, I hate the fucking irony. I have nothing to offer. No cash, no future, no personality and lazy as fuck. The thought of catering to one more person's needs in my life horrifies me.   


No skills. Social, or work related. Basically something of a mute irl. Can't work hard jobs. Won't work hard jobs, but don't have studies to get me a good job.   


Wanted to relearn math, but how ? I don't have time. Fear paralyzes me. I can't focus on anything. I don't understand why. Simple tasks like cleaning the kitchen take me more than half a day instead of 2 hours, I have to read stuff 5-6 times before I can even understand what I read, and it takes me days to even start tasks. I fidget all the time, my mind always goes different places, can't even focus in a conversation. It's all so confusing.  
 

Is this it ? Is this life ? Being expected to break my back for some measly sum of cash ? I don't want it.   


Freedom can only be bought. My illnesses can only be fixed with cash. Everything would be better with money, but it's just not worth it.   


I think I'm broken. I'd rather die than struggle another day in my life like I did in my one and only job.   


I can no longer wait for my grandmother to die anymore, I need to get out, she didn't even help that much, I need to buy the gas tank.   


I hate everything. I regret everything. Seriously fuck this joke that's called a gift. I can't wait to get out. I can't wait to be finally fucking free. I will finally be free. I will finally be my own. Finally nobody can tell me what to do. I can finally get my own way in life. For once in my whole life I can get something that I wanted without begging or having others use me. I can finally have some quiet. Finally I can get away from the dirt.

&lt;p&gt;Nobody really gives a shit about me. My life was ruined by those around me, and worse, I did nothing to lift myself up. Feeling lost my whole life, alone, and in constant fear.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a little boy, my parents fought very often. My father was an alcoholic, and my mother wasn&amp;#39;t satisfied with him, she wanted a life of luxury. They got divorced. I&amp;#39;ve been told that my mother didn&amp;#39;t even want to have me, but I didn&amp;#39;t believe any of them, as I&amp;#39;ve loved my mother and hated my father. The day comes when I have to make the choice in court with whom to stay, my mother tells me that life would be hars with her, I should do whatever I want. The intent in her voice clearly said she didn&amp;#39;t want me. I was mortified. My whole childhood flashed before me, and I saw my mother, I saw the truth, she was never actually there. Most of her free time she&amp;#39;d go out to cheat on my father hoping she&amp;#39;d hook a bigger fish, and leave me home with a can of food.&lt;br/&gt;
 My father&amp;#39;s turn comes, it was all scripted, he said you make your own choice, but I knew he didn&amp;#39;t want me, he even said to my family that I should go with my mother, but they guilted him into taking me. Not because they cared about me, but because it would be a bad image for the family. I had no choice but to go with him, it&amp;#39;s in his house that I grew up.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been told growing up that I was a smart kid. But nobody wanted to help me. I was lost, I felt alone, confused. Couldn&amp;#39;t focus on studying, struggling. Nothing came out of it. Other members of the family hated me, even openly. The thought that I was better than their own kid ticked them off, said I did nothing to deserve it and only cheated.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My cousin (she) hated me the most, but for a different reason. For being my mother&amp;#39;s son. My mother envied her for being prettier, better at hooking old rich guys, and called her a whore, after she told my father that my mother was cheating on him.

,SuicideWatch,"Today was an awful day after an awful week in an awful month of an awful year in my awful life. A couple of months ago I ended my relationship by being a piece of shit that prefered drowning in his own depression, sorrow and bad memories, compensated by scrolling through an ig feed full of bi\*\*hes, instead of being actually happy with what I have. A long journey of pain and suffering since then, led to a full week of incredible back pain from a work accident and my self inflicted headaches. I have months of therapy behind me, mainly focusing on my addictions, tendencies to destroy myself and the endless thoughts of killing myself out of so many reasons. Sadness, loniless, anger, desperassion, guilt and pure revenge on the people that sometimes also were assholes to me.

Yesterday was a day I spent crying for hours, with little breaks in gaming or trying to watch a movie that I didnt give a shit about. So today I woke up and tried to have a normal day. I couldnt. I watched another movie again that I discovered recently and loved a lot. I listened to a little bit of music and wanted to meet the person that I love for the last time, because I made up my mind. I'm gonna visit her and a few places and then I fuck off of this world for good. Best for everybody. She wasnt there. Didnt really respond properly on phone, until not at all anymore. I dont even know where she was butr since she didnt want to tell me its probably what I'm thinking since months. Theres another man. Or several. Even if she is just having fun with friends, she ignores my plead for help. And that made me mad. I visited the spot where I always met with my, now deceased, best friend/sisterfromanothermother/guardian/soulmate/overall\_best\_person\_I\_ever\_met and wrote my love a last message. 

I drove around a bit and after one or two hours I found a bridge. Its a pretty high bridge on the highway. I parked my car and sat on the barrier a little bit. Long. Thinking about all my life, the good things and all the horrible thigns that changed me into a person that neither myself nor my girlfriend could ever really love, or even like. I was reaching the end and my mind was made up.. I was ready.

A car parked behind mine. A woman stepped out and asked my if everything was ok. I was already sitting on the reiling, which has to look insane to a normal person, since the bridge is easily between 50-100 meters high. She asked if everything was ok. I responded it will be. Well to cut this a little bit short, she talked me into talking to her and I told her a lot about myself. Well in the end, she said she would feel sad if I would not continue. So here I am. Feeling more guilt, freezing because it was raining and I literally had only a shirt and shorts on and still not knowing which piece of shit is probably fucking the love of my life atm after she had an awesome fucking saturday evening and night. And I'm at the same fucking spot, I was yesterday. And tomorrow, I will be at the same fucking spot that I was today. 

The thing that I am really, really mad about right now, is my fucking cowardness of not just FUCKING SHOWING EVERYONE THAT I MEAN IT! THAT I AM NOT PLAYING! THAT IT HAS TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BEFORE EVERYONE STANDS AROUND A FUCKING GRAVE SAYING SHIT LIKE WE DIDNT SEE IT COMING! WHY WOULD HE DO THIS?

,SuicideWatch,"Every day I feel like I don’t wanna wake up anymore. I’m tired of crying; nonstop, for days straight. 

I’m so tired of being scared to reach out to people about how I feel. Why? Because they get mad at me for “bringing problems” and being “unstable”. 

Tired of putting on a smile, it’s very draining…

I wish I was dead, either by some accident or something else because I don’t have the courage to take away my life. But sometimes I do feel like taking my life.

I just want the pain to go away, I wanna be happy. I honestly forgot how happiness feels like, I don’t even remember the last time I ever felt happy.

Reasons as to why I feel this way:

1.) For once, I just want somebody to tell me how proud they are of me, I just want somebody to support me and show me how much they love me. My mother and step-father never said ""I’m proud of you” to me. They always congratulate their two other kids and spoil the heck outta them.

2.) My mother is an abusive person: she gaslights a lot, she plays the victim a lot, she’s very manipulative, verbally and emotionally abuses me, she takes away my money and never gives it back, and she never takes responsibility for her actions. 

3.) I was kicked out of home when I was 17 and she didn’t do anything to help me. I had to be moving from home to home in search of a better place to live. I almost got s*xually ass*ulted by some dude in a home I was living in💀

4.) recovering from an abusive relationship. The scars are still here and the trauma won’t go away any time soon.

,SuicideWatch,"im currently a rising sophomore in college, and i had a long term boyfriend during junior and senior year in highschool. in january of this year, we officially broke up because of long distance (i just left to go to a college 600 miles away) but we still had feelings for each other. since then, we have still been talking on and off. i still love him, and up until yesterday, i thought he felt the same. 

when i came home for the summer, we saw each other for two weeks before he left to go on a 1.5 month roadtrip. by the time he got back, id already left to do a summer semester at my college. he rarely had cell service on his trip, so it was hard to talk. one week before he came home, he called me and told me that we should completely break things off this time. he said he needed to focus on school and didnt have time for a relationship, even though he still cared about me. i was heartbroken, but i respected his decision. one thing i did ask tho, was that he should tell me when he stops having feelings for me. this was two weeks ago. 

yesterday, he posts on social media, and a girl i dont know comments that hes cute. i look at her account, and she has posted pictures with him from last week. they were clearly very, very close in the pictures. i was so confused. we had stopped talking a week before these pictures were taken, i couldnt understand how he moved on so fast. 

we have always had a very healthy and honest relationship, so i texted him to try and figure out what was going on. i asked how he moved on so fast, how long he knew this girl, and other questions to try and figure out what was happening. apparently he only started seeing her after he got home from his trip (theyre coworkers) but he does like her, even though he doesnt know if it will lead anywhere. at this point im still so confused so i asked him, why he didnt tell me when he stopped loving me like i wanted him to? and how long ago did he stop loving me?

it was 6 months ago. he said that when he couldnt see me as often as he used to, he lost feelings for me. he had stopped loving me when i left 6 months ago, after loving me for more than 2 years. every single day since i left, i have thought about him every day and i know i still love him. i asked him if he could move on so fast, did he even love me at all. he just told me that he doesnt understand what love is. i am absolutely heart broken. especially because i have screenshots of him texting me that “no amount of time away from you can change the way i feel about you” and “my love for you is forever.” we even talked about marriage and a long term future together. now i realize that its all a lie. 

before we met, i was severely suicidal. i had no friends and no one cared about me. but once i transferred schools i met him, and my life turned completely around. he made me happier than no one ever has. my step mom always praised us for how amazing our relationship was, and always said that we were so lucky to have something like this. she predicted that we would get married. 

i thought i was unlovable, but he was the only person who could love me. i was wrong, as it turns out he cant even say that he did love me anymore. even before he broke things off for good, i started contemplating suicide again. im undecided for my major in college and have no hobbies, talents, or special interests, and i dont think im ever going to find a job that i will like. ive felt like this for years, but my ex boyfriend was the one thing that kept me hopeful. now i just found out he doesnt love me, hasnt loved me for months, and i have no hope left. i was unhappy before he came into my life, and now that hes gone i know nothing is going to get better for me. 

i never attempted to take my life before because i was afraid of the pain, but i dont think anything can feel as bad as this does now. ive already written a suicide note to leave him, and in the next couple of weeks i will probably kill myself. i just wish i would have done it before i met him.

,SuicideWatch,"Sorry for bad format, on mobile and crying

I (22M) started at my job a little under 2 years ago. My best friend K (20F) started about 3.5 months ago. There's a very high turnover rate here and generally people last about 3-6 months I've noticed. I work at a relatively small bakery and we only ever really have about 14 people employed (baking and sales staff)

For a while I've struggled with depression and would occasionally have mental breakdowns from loneliness and other similar things, but when K started working here we immediately bonded over our love for bad puns. We'd constantly make the same bad jokes and follow them up with finger guns and after a bit I'd be able to go to sleep looking forward to work the next day.

Now I like the owner and he likes me a lot as well, but he would understand us and the baking team would occasionally have to help the sales team when it got busy, K really hated this and would talk about it, and the owner would hear her talking about it. She got a warning last week and got fired today and ever since hearing about it I've been crying, knowing that work will never be the same. Every Sunday and Monday we'd open the bakery and be alone for 2 hours telling stories, listening to music, sharing puns, and having a great time (while working, obviously). Occasionally we'd have these deep conversations about past traumas, family issues, unrequited love, and all that jazz. I can't handle the thought knowing that now I won't be able to look forward to my Sunday and Monday shifts. I'd have more fun at work those days than I do on my days off. I used to think about killing myself quite a bit and since becoming friends with K I haven't thought about suicide at all and now I know that work will never be as good as it was before. I'm sick of training people, becoming acquainted with them and then seeing them leave, and I was not ready to become best friends with someone just to see her go like this. We're still gonna be friends of course and hang out with our free time, but now work is gonna be boring and make me feel numb. I just wanna go back to the way things were.

I can&amp;#39;t handle the thought knowing that now I won&amp;#39;t be able to look forward to my Sunday and Monday shifts. I&amp;#39;d have more fun at work those days than I do on my days off. I used to think about killing myself quite a bit and since becoming friends with K I haven&amp;#39;t thought about suicide at all and now I know that work will never be as good as it was before. I&amp;#39;m sick of training people, becoming acquainted with them and then seeing them leave, and I was not ready to become best friends with someone just to see her go like this. We&amp;#39;re still gonna be friends of course and hang out with our free time, but now work is gonna be boring and make me feel numb. I just wanna go back to the way things were.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, after saying this I will mention that I&amp;#39;d never kill myself. K and I have discussed that if either of us were to die it would ruin the other one&amp;#39;s life and I could never do that to her.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I just turned 19 and I already want to be gone.

I've been feeling so bad for the last years since middle school, idk how I got so far without going already. I don't feel the motivation to do anything I used to love, I can't listen to music because my head hurts like hell, i stopped eating some days ago, i can't even play games I liked. 

I don't have friends, I've been stressing my bf because idk how to cope with this, I already had three psychologists that were just so bad, i told them specifically to not tell my parents because I know how bad the already think about me, but they told them anyway so I can't find help in those people. 

I feel so lonely and the feeling just keeps on growing everyday, i stopped talking to some ""friends"" because I was always the one to talk first. It's been two days since I told them I'm done with my life and no one has said anything to me. That's just how much they cared about me.

I know it's my fault because I'm always feeling bad, i always feel like I'm just a stubborn that I don't belong no matter where it is. The only friends I thought I had were my bf's friends and not mine. So maybe that's another reason.

I've stopped doing my homework too, I don't care about it anymore. My family doesn't care either, my mom just fucks with my stepdad even when he makes her cry and hurts and yells to my little sister. Just because I'm not his real blood daughter like my little sister he makes my life a living hell. He always tells my mom it's my fault everything that has happened to her. It's always my fault. She never wants to listen to me. She tells she shouldn't had took care of me or throw me to the trash when she could. 

I miss my bf, but he hasn't sent me anything since a couple days. I'm tired of crying everyday even now I can't stop i just cry and cry and no one cares. I feel so lonely here. I thought I could overcome this by going out of my parents house in some years but I can't stand it anymore. I just making my bf mad and angry, just stressing him because idk how to stop feeling like shit. I know it's tiring to deal with me, i know I can't get easily convinced of the contrary to what I say. But I just wanted your love, i just wanted your care, your worries, i just wanted a hug, I wanted to be told that everything would be fine, I wanted to feel happy, I wanted to feel secure, I wanted you to keep insisting that you love me even tho I keep saying that I don't deserve your love, you told me it didn't matter how bad i get everytime I fall in this shit, that you would always be there for me, i thought I had someone, i thought so many things. 

But now i don't anyone again. My grandma, who was more my mother than my mother, is dead. My mom doesn't love me because of that stupid man in the house that's i can't even call a stepdad because he was never my father. My little sister is growing in fear and I can't do anything because she's starting to think like them, selfish, yelling for anything, even hurting me if she doesn't get what she wants, just like them.

I'm so tired of everything, and I don't know what to do anymore. I really wanted to changed, i tried so hard. I just feel like i can't be here anymore, thats why I stopped eating, hopefully I'll die of hunger in a couple days or maybe my sugar levels will increase and I'll die of it. 

I just want it to end. Idek why I'm writing this here. No one will care anyway, I know it's supposed to be to maybe help a little. But man, you and me know we're just strangers on the internet. Why would someone care or be really concerned. Even when I kms no one will cry, no one will miss me, because no one really knew me. Just this rant that I'm writing while crying because I care anymore I'm just so tired and so lonely I just want people to talk to me to tell me not to do it, even when I know I'll still feel the same. i just want it to stop. i don't want to be alone anymore. i feel so scared. i feel like a little child wanting a hug from their mother but not knowing where she is. it hurts more to know that she will never hug me, she hasn't since I was a kid. ijustwanttodie iwanttostopbreathing iwanttostopfeeling ihateithere why did I had to be born this way?????? why can't anything get better

,SuicideWatch," Sometimes reading other people's posts here on Reddit who are having a bad time in life makes me feel less alone. Maybe it isn't the best I can do but I do it, I always come to take refuge in the words of strangers on the Internet who may not even be telling the truth. If someone does this same thing that I do, then here is my post so that you feel accompanied in anguish.

 A few years ago I began to fall into a bottomless maze. Everything from bad to worse, everything in pieces. I attended psychologists and psychiatrists but none of them managed to fully help me. The medication kept me stable for almost two years so I didn't feel the need to unalive myself. On the other hand, psychologists recommended things like *meditation* and *deep breaths* that didn't help me at all. Maybe the trauma is not solved that way, ~~maybe it is never solved~~. (And yes, I have a virtual library full of workbooks for social anxiety, depression, an eating disorder, a personality disorder, and PTSD, but things are still complicated).

 Today I'm in what many call the ""best years of life"" (almost 22) and I must admit that I have not really enjoyed or been happy since I was 10 or so. I don't have a college degree or a job. Until last year I had 6 friends and today I have none left, I was distancing myself from everyone because of the damage that I supposed I was doing to them. I don't have a partner nor do I get along with my family. Anyways, I'm mired in loneliness and uselessness.

 Knowing all this, I can assume that rather than being in the ""best years"" I'm in *the years of greatest sadness and detachment from reality*. I have a plan in case things get worse because things can always get worse, even when you think you are completely lost. I have the letters ready to be sent and also other things.

&lt;p&gt;While the day-to-day feels like nonsense, I wish I could progress. I wish that if you got here reading you can also achieve the best for your life. There are many people who say that things get better. Is it a matter of believing their words?&lt;/p&gt;

Repeat forever apparently.

I hate my job, I hate my entire life. The job allows me to work remote so I stay in bed all day and this helps cut some costs (gas, dumb 'convenience' foods for lunch, car wear and tear) and saves me  from having to wake up an hour early to get ready and commute but the pay is dog shit and the area I live in is nice but the only other job options seem to be similarly dog shit paying ones. I live out near a college, and the only jobs here are basically retail to give the fucking stupid college kids something to do. 

I want to be a personal trainer and I know I can do that because I've been the go-to free trainer for all of my friends and girlfriends. I look like I'm on steroids according to everyone that compliments my physique, I have won powerlifting competitions and am almost to the point where I can take some records. I know everything about nutritional science, biomechanics, anatomy, exercise science, basically I digested every single bit of information over the past 12 years that relates in any way to what I do and what I would need to know to train people. I did it all to make myself better at this shit, but thanks to all of that research I can absolutely say I can do the job I want to do. I am the go-to guy in my gym when I'm there for random questions/advice, everyone seems to want to ask me for help on this or that movement or whatever muscle group they're trying to build more or ask me if I know why X body part is hurting in XYZ way. The gym related parts of my life do not depress me; This is literally the only thing I enjoy, hence I would like to turn it into a career path and finally have a job that MATTERS. I am so sick of working jobs that do not fucking matter. If I suddenly stop showing up, nothing changes at all. I am tired of being expendable and useless to some stupid company.

Anyway this unfortunately requires degrees or licenses because clearly you can't just look at me and know that I know what the fuck I'm talking about/what I'm doing, and those cost MONEY. Oh lord, the most important and only thing in all of life: Money! Moneyyyyy! Gotta have money! The fucking idiots that have it can go get their licenses and then do the job I want to be doing but with a fraction of the knowledge and no general fucking clue what they're doing. I see so many fucking people who are licensed to do the job I want to do, the job I could do way fucking better than they can, that don't know their god damn head from their ass hole. But no, they got the fancy piece of paper that says they're allowed to do it so they're allowed to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

All my friends tell me ""Oh just save up money! Just save the money and get the license!"" Okay, how? On my shit-tier pay, with all my bills to pay which basically eats up every single cent I get each month. How the fuck am I gonna save? Then they tell me, ""Oh just move back to the city and get a job here plenty of jobs here"" Okay, how? How do I just go about violating my apartment lease to move to a new apartment? Who's gonna pay all the move-in costs for me? Who's gonna pay for the rest of the lease that I'm breaking? Or they say ""Oh just get another job out there then!"" Okay, let me just gamble by leaving the current job and hope that the one I end up in doesn't tank or isn't something I can handle on a daily basis. Sure, let me just risk being completely broke and homeless on a whim with no safety net or savings.

My friends all are the types that got massively fucking lucky somehow and got nice jobs so they could get houses before turning 25 already but they just fucking stumbled their way into those jobs. It's like their life path was determined and no matter what they would've ended up well-off at this point no matter what the fuck they did. None of them are any sort of above-average in any way yet they landed jobs that are far above average in pay and wouldn't ya know it, they're also easy jobs and they \*LOVE\* their jobs SO MUCH!!

I'm fucking sick and tired of this shit! I am far smarter than any of them and I could very easily do all of their fucking jobs better than they can but noooooo I don't get those opportunities. So now they get to sit their in their houses and tell me to do this or that as if they actually fucking have a clue why they got to where they are. Their advice is terrible, it's bullshit and after I rip it apart logically they all get pissy because I'm 'just being negative and defeatist'. If the advice/suggestions are so easy to pick apart, maybe it's because they fucking suck and won't work in reality! Not all of us had our parents help us so much then somehow magically landed some incredible paying job. 

And I'm fucking sick of all the god damn activities I used to enjoy. I used to like gaming, now it is so fucking incredibly boring I can barely stomach anything for more than 20 minutes. I used to enjoy watching anime and movies but I sat and ran through everything good on marathon for a few years and now there's nothing to watch. One or two good movies come out a year, and no good anime has come out in fucking forever. But really all these did was keep me complacent and entertained enough to not think about reality.

In reality, I am 30 years old making shitty fucking pay at a shitty fucking job and because of the cost of all my bills and groceries I am unable to save anything because I barely break even every month. I have an incredibly brilliant mind overall, and in regards to the one thing I actually want to do for a career I would excel at it without issue. I have built a body that other men dream they could, I have moved weights and performed athletic feats that are impossible for 99.9999999% of the population which one would assume should work in my favor for my chosen career path but I am stuck unable to do what I want because I don't have some tiny piece of fucking paper that 'allows' me to do the job and being intelligent only makes me able to realize how incredibly stupid and unfair this whole life has been.

I envy the stupid people of the world because they don't have the ability to think about the world and realize how pointless and unfair it all is.

At this moment, the only ones affected by my discontinued existence would be my cats and I'm sure someone would be more than happy to take them anyway. I have nothing to live for, I provide nothing to the world, if I didn't exist tomorrow nothing would change. I don't want to just keep living paycheck to paycheck, just surviving, for another 60-70 years. I just do not see a point to carrying on when I'm not going to achieve the life I want. Self-help shit, motivational shit, none of it works on me because my brain rips the words to pieces and none of it applies to me. I don't expect any useful information or advice from this, I just needed to vent this all out anonymously because if I send it to people who know my address they'll call the police and an ambulance to come visit me and check on me and I don't want that shit because they're not going to help fix the problems in my life they're just going to try and force me to stay alive unhappily. I do not want to be here anymore. Anyone who tries to tell you that life has some purpose or meaning or point is fucking lying. Either you pulled the right number out of the hat when you were born and will have everything given to you or you'll just be stuck existing and watching everyone else be happy but never be happy yourself.

&lt;p&gt;In reality, I am 30 years old making shitty fucking pay at a shitty fucking job and because of the cost of all my bills and groceries I am unable to save anything because I barely break even every month. I have an incredibly brilliant mind overall, and in regards to the one thing I actually want to do for a career I would excel at it without issue. I have built a body that other men dream they could, I have moved weights and performed athletic feats that are impossible for 99.9999999% of the population which one would assume should work in my favor for my chosen career path but I am stuck unable to do what I want because I don&amp;#39;t have some tiny piece of fucking paper that &amp;#39;allows&amp;#39; me to do the job and being intelligent only makes me able to realize how incredibly stupid and unfair this whole life has been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I envy the stupid people of the world because they don&amp;#39;t have the ability to think about the world and realize how pointless and unfair it all is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this moment, the only ones affected by my discontinued existence would be my cats and I&amp;#39;m sure someone would be more than happy to take them anyway. I have nothing to live for, I provide nothing to the world, if I didn&amp;#39;t exist tomorrow nothing would change. I don&amp;#39;t want to just keep living paycheck to paycheck, just surviving, for another 60-70 years. I just do not see a point to carrying on when I&amp;#39;m not going to achieve the life I want. Self-help shit, motivational shit, none of it works on me because my brain rips the words to pieces and none of it applies to me. I don&amp;#39;t expect any useful information or advice from this, I just needed to vent this all out anonymously because if I send it to people who know my address they&amp;#39;ll call the police and an ambulance to come visit me and check on me and I don&amp;#39;t want that shit because they&amp;#39;re not going to help fix the problems in my life they&amp;#39;re just going to try and force me to stay alive unhappily. I do not want to be here anymore. Anyone who tries to tell you that life has some purpose or meaning or point is fucking lying. Either you pulled the right number out of the hat when you were born and will have everything given to you or you&amp;#39;ll just be stuck existing and watching everyone else be happy but never be happy yourself. I didn&amp;#39;t get lucky at birth, and I will never have what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Well, it finally happened. In 2011 I met a girl and we dated for 7 years. Throughout the relationship she said she couldn't have kids. I wanted kids but I stayed with her and said it's ok if we can't. After 7 years she cheated on me and got pregnant to another guy. I was depressed for 3 years straight.

Then in 2020, I met a woman on a paid-for dating site. I assumed it would help me to find someone serious. Well, it turned out after several months of getting to know her and bond with her 2 children that she was a prostitute (a real prostitute) and had been sleeping with men behind my back.

We had some furious arguments and in a drunken argument (her drunk), she said ""you mean less to me than air"".

When she said this. I lost it. I was so so so so hurt. She ended up blocking me on everything. I sent a whole bunch of emails asking if we can talk. Long story short, she stopped emailing me back and left me blocked. Today I found out she's been dating other guys.

I live alone. And I work from home. I'm at home practically 24/7. This evening I just broken down. A 31 year old male, just broken down crying.

In 2011 I met a girl and we dated for 7 years. Throughout the relationship she said she couldn&amp;#39;t have kids. I wanted kids but I stayed with her and said it&amp;#39;s ok if we can&amp;#39;t. After 7 years she cheated on me and got pregnant to another guy. I was depressed for 3 years straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in 2020, I met a woman on a paid-for dating site. I assumed it would help me to find someone serious. Well, it turned out after several months of getting to know her and bond with her 2 children that she was a prostitute (a real prostitute) and had been sleeping with men behind my back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had some furious arguments and in a drunken argument (her drunk), she said &amp;quot;you mean less to me than air&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she said this. I lost it. I was so so so so hurt. She ended up blocking me on everything. I sent a whole bunch of emails asking if we can talk. Long story short, she stopped emailing me back and left me blocked. Today I found out she&amp;#39;s been dating other guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live alone. And I work from home. I&amp;#39;m at home practically 24/7. This evening I just broken down. A 31 year old male, just broken down crying. I&amp;#39;m currently laying on my bed with the fan on drying my tears. I&amp;#39;ve had too much pain. Too much heartbreak. I can&amp;#39;t take it anymore. I just want to love someone and be loved.&lt;/p&gt;

The only things that keep all this out my mind is playing games, watching youtube, marvel movies, tv series, masturbating, sexting with girls just as desperate as I am. Surprised women even want to sext with me.

That is one thing that gives me hope. Maybe I'm not as ugly and pathetic as I think I am if a girl actually wants to do something like that with me.

I've only ever had online sexual relationships. Nothing even close in person. Masturbating so much makes crave sex but it definitely helps with my anxiety. I don't know if I'll ever be ready for life or a real relationship at this rate.

&amp;#x200B;

I always feel like when I finally find real love in person with a girl who loves me that my life would be so much better just having someone there for me if all goes well.

I would make sure not to hurt her in any way. It feels like finding love would rid me of most of my problems.

I really wanna better myself to be a man worthy of love but at the same time it's hard to find the motivation when I don't have anyone there for me aside from my parents who hate each other. My father used to be kinda abusive but he stopped completely but he still yells at the top of his lungs when upset. 

Anyways how do people find love outside of social media. Is it at work? Do they just ask a random stranger? Does it just happen from constantly talking to people? 

A girlfriend would really help me. I know you can't just find love that easy though. She would also have to have similar sexual desires as me and when I say this I just mean wanting sex at least once a week.

,SuicideWatch,"This is literally super weird, and idk why did my dad involve the cats.
My sister and I were arguing about why my method of cleaning the poop was wrong or right. And my dad just comes in and screams that the cats gotta be thrown away ND throws them away ""because we can't take care of them"" when my sister and I were clearly discussing about that. 

I consider animals equal to ourselves after looking at things more spiritually, like animals having no sense of judgement... and people using their reason of judgment to do evil, all that sort of thing. I've always seen the innocence of animals the thing that makes them equal to humans having the capacity to reason and think of abstract concepts of good and evil and the likes of empathy. (Not vegan btw, I still consume animal products) 

With that said, I'm more shocked at how ignorant my dad is (that I'm gonna be stuck with for three more years) putting animals in potential pain because some trivial argument about how poop should be cleaned. 

I wonder if back in older times it was usual to put animals in suffering to punish siblings arguing about trivial stuff.

He could have perfectly scolded both of us, banned me and my sister of WiFi... these are material things, they don't really suffer. Idk why would my dad think that it would be a good punishment for us to throw the cats to the street to punish us siblings for arguing about poop (which the poop didn't bother him at all). 

I was about to cut myself until my mom found me pressing the knife against my arm, I was ready to bleed out (hopefully) just to make some miserable old man wake up from ignorance.

It reminds me of that time where ppl blamed videogames for school shootings. Completely unrelated reasons for a kid to decide shoot a school.
And some hard headed people still think the same because they can't handle the facts... it saddens me that ignorance is selective.

Ignorance is, in my opinion, the worst human disease, because some people can really choose to have it.
And it hurts that humans choose to put other lifeforms in pain because of that.

Right now I'm in my aunt's house (who somehow ""understands"" the actions of my dad) with one of the cats that I managed to find (because the other one goes searching for mates and all) and we are pretty chill here. The cat is very attached to me, my sister and mom because we pretty much raised them.

I don't like when people take someone's child away, that just sucks.
So many knifes and one cut is, what I think, all I need to wake some people up.

It's 5 AM now, I've been crying for the past 7 hours sensing the heartbeat of my cat in my hands. There are things worse than death, and I feel like I can ensure my cat's good life if I die. After all there are worse things than death.
If i stop suffering then my cats will hopefully stop suffering too.

After all I'm doing this all for myself, right? Because my moral judgment will not let my mind suffer from not obeying it... The foundation of empathy and reason imprinted in my brain. What makes me human that is. 

Killing my dad? Never. 

I can't kill people, there are other people who care for people. 
I couldn't bear knowing that someone is suffering because I took someone's life. 

Hey I'm just 18, people have known me for... 18 years, people have known my dad for more than 50 years. 

People would certainly forget about me easily. 

This ""fleeting sadness"" isn't depression, I know. 
But it's so recurrent and reappearing in my life that I might as well make myself not conscious anymore. 

I've always been a loyal believer of Christianity and it's philosophy. 
But man, if I have to go to hell for the greater good, I will do it.

And my dad just comes in and screams that the cats gotta be thrown away ND throws them away &amp;quot;because we can&amp;#39;t take care of them&amp;quot; when my sister and I were clearly discussing about that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider animals equal to ourselves after looking at things more spiritually, like animals having no sense of judgement... and people using their reason of judgment to do evil, all that sort of thing. I&amp;#39;ve always seen the innocence of animals the thing that makes them equal to humans having the capacity to reason and think of abstract concepts of good and evil and the likes of empathy. (Not vegan btw, I still consume animal products) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, I&amp;#39;m more shocked at how ignorant my dad is (that I&amp;#39;m gonna be stuck with for three more years) putting animals in potential pain because some trivial argument about how poop should be cleaned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if back in older times it was usual to put animals in suffering to punish siblings arguing about trivial stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He could have perfectly scolded both of us, banned me and my sister of WiFi... these are material things, they don&amp;#39;t really suffer. Idk why would my dad think that it would be a good punishment for us to throw the cats to the street to punish us siblings for arguing about poop (which the poop didn&amp;#39;t bother him at all). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was about to cut myself until my mom found me pressing the knife against my arm, I was ready to bleed out (hopefully) just to make some miserable old man wake up from ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of that time where ppl blamed videogames for school shootings. Completely unrelated reasons for a kid to decide shoot a school.
And some hard headed people still think the same because they can&amp;#39;t handle the facts... it saddens me that ignorance is selective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignorance is, in my opinion, the worst human disease, because some people can really choose to have it.
And it hurts that humans choose to put other lifeforms in pain because of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I&amp;#39;m in my aunt&amp;#39;s house (who somehow &amp;quot;understands&amp;quot; the actions of my dad) with one of the cats that I managed to find (because the other one goes searching for mates and all) and we are pretty chill here. The cat is very attached to me, my sister and mom because we pretty much raised them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t like when people take someone&amp;#39;s child away, that just sucks.
So many knifes and one cut is, what I think, all I need to wake some people up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 5 AM now, I&amp;#39;ve been crying for the past 7 hours sensing the heartbeat of my cat in my hands. There are things worse than death, and I feel like I can ensure my cat&amp;#39;s good life if I die. After all there are worse things than death.
If i stop suffering then my cats will hopefully stop suffering too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all I&amp;#39;m doing this all for myself, right? Because my moral judgment will not let my mind suffer from not obeying it... The foundation of empathy and reason imprinted in my brain. What makes me human that is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Killing my dad? Never. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t kill people, there are other people who care for people. 
I couldn&amp;#39;t bear knowing that someone is suffering because I took someone&amp;#39;s life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey I&amp;#39;m just 18, people have known me for... 18 years, people have known my dad for more than 50 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People would certainly forget about me easily. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &amp;quot;fleeting sadness&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t depression, I know. 
But it&amp;#39;s so recurrent and reappearing in my life that I might as well make myself not conscious anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been a loyal believer of Christianity and it&amp;#39;s philosophy. 
But man, if I have to go to hell for the greater good, I will do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Heck, that even sounds like a Doom line)&lt;/p&gt;

She got exceptionally scared and said that I need to get out. That she needed to sleep alone tonight and that I would need to sleep on the couch.

I apologised for raising my voice and she didn't answer. I told her that I was getting a panic attack starting because of what was happening and she didn't answer. I understand that she wouldn't answer because what I was saying wasn't helpful to the situation and she's right that it wasn't.

I had to leave the room multiple times, because I was frustrating and upsetting her each time that I wasn't apologising properly for scaring her, and because I wasn't showing any sympathy for how she felt and that she was scared.
During one of those leaves I self-harmed. Both with striking myself and strangulation. Before returning and trying again.

2 months ago I was extremely content and hopeful about my life. I had just quit my 9-6:30+ to pursue freelance work full time and make my own schedule. Just moved into a really nice house. Hosted a birthday party with 30+ friends in attendance. Things were great until my actual birthday came around the next week, then everything fell apart. 

I had contacted a close friend about why they weren’t in attendance at my birthday and why I hadn’t heard from them at all. Wasn’t aggressive, just worried about my friend is all. They blocked my number and my social media without responding after I reached out.

Long story short, this person had begun to communicate with my 3 closest friends telling them I had done something harmful to them and that they need to drop communicating with me for a period of time.

One month later (after being in the dark and shunned by others) I learned that this person had been spreading a lie about me stating that I had sexually violated them when in reality I did not. All of my friends believed them because they were the “victim” in this scenario. I can’t blame them. Just wish they would believe me instead. 

Since then I have lost virtually everything while trying to defend myself. I was kicked out of my house, fired from my jobs, lost my business partner, my friends, and the will to live.

1. Bee work is hard, hot, gross, and painful. I'm only doing it because there's supposed to be a musical element, but listening in on the main character's phone calls, the production company is fighting over the right to control the show's music. Even if he gets to do it, there's a lot of people who are gonna be in this ""band"", so you have to insert yourself into every song you can. Never having been in a band, I don't know how to walk the line between bossy/aggressive and too passive. Everyone else I know of involved in this aspect of the show has experience in bands and knows better how to walk this line, not to mention a lot of them know each other and I don't know any of them (though I've met a few briefly). You can't do the music stuff without doing the bee stuff (which I really suck at, even for a beginner). Even if I do stick it out they might not choose me to be on the show, and if they do I might be the idiot character (reality tv can twist ""reality"" however they want, and I do a lot of idiotic stuff on the jobs gauging by the others' reactions).     
2. I didn't have to do any work to move onto the next grade level until 8th grade, so in a way that way my first real year of school. Not surprisingly, I really suck at the whole school thing (it took me five years to graduate highschool, and that was with an unbelievable amount of slack cut for me). Mental illness gets in the way a lot, and even if I do manage to get a degree I'm worried I'll just get a job I hate and work until either I die or I'm too old to do anything anyway. Going straight to working leads to this problem as well. I don't know that there's anything I can do almost everyday for that long without growing to hate it.   
3. I'm already 23 and basically living with my parents (unless I keep doing the bee stuff, I've been living in the place they operate from for less than 2 weeks). I've already become more of a loser every year that passes since I graduated highschool, and I don't want to continue becoming more and more of a loser until I'm 30 living with my aging parents (my parents are in their early 60's, so they probably have less than two decades to go).       
4. I don't really see too many disadvantages from killing myself aside from making some people sad. I acknowledge that that is a big disadvantage of that path, but would the sadness they feel at my passing over their lives equal that which I would experience over my life if I were to live?

,SuicideWatch,"Yesterday, I wrapped a phone charger around my neck. I’m a coward, though, so I couldn’t physically get it tighter than uncomfortable. Even then, after a little while, I wanted to take it off. I could feel my pulse through the cord and I wanted to cry. What a p*ssy-ass-bitch. I didn’t take it off, though, and instead called the suicide hotline where I was put on hold for a long time. Then, my (ex?)partner walked into the room, looked at me like the pathetic piece of trash I am, removed the chord, and pulled me into the living room for “supervision” while they played video games. Time went by way too fast. My (ex?)partner told me to go to bed, but not without also commenting that they hadn’t eaten anything. I hadn’t cooked dinner, you see, so they went without food.

Why am I such a coward?? Why couldn’t I do it? Why do I have to continuously live like this??? I want to get better but it feels impossible. I feel trapped and I want to feel free. I want my own space away from people so I can work through my sh*t without also having to accommodate other people.

I’m a coward, though, so I couldn’t physically get it tighter than uncomfortable. Even then, after a little while, I wanted to take it off. I could feel my pulse through the cord and I wanted to cry. What a p*ssy-ass-bitch. I didn’t take it off, though, and instead called the suicide hotline where I was put on hold for a long time. Then, my (ex?)partner walked into the room, looked at me like the pathetic piece of trash I am, removed the chord, and pulled me into the living room for “supervision” while they played video games. Time went by way too fast. My (ex?)partner told me to go to bed, but not without also commenting that they hadn’t eaten anything. I hadn’t cooked dinner, you see, so they went without food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why am I such a coward?? Why couldn’t I do it? Why do I have to continuously live like this??? I want to get better but it feels impossible. I feel trapped and I want to feel free. I want my own space away from people so I can work through my sh*t without also having to accommodate other people.

&lt;p&gt;And I also find myself thinking, maybe this person will realize how their actions affected me or how they should have appreciated. And I’m thinking damn I’m a shitty person, what kind of childish stuff is that for me to say&lt;/p&gt;

I hate it. I hate that life will only get more stressful from this point on. I feel like I can barely handle all the responsibilities placed onto me already. 

My mother and I have always struggled with finances. Always stressed about having our basic needs met. We always have to sacrifice something in order to pay the bills or put food on the table. 

To top it off I have no social skills and I think this is the most insecure I've ever been. I'm not at peak health, making me look unattractive, which is extremely important at this age. I'm too depressed to do basic things like brush my teeth and work out consistently. It's never consistent. 

My grades are the lowest they've ever been. I've had decent grades but keeping them up put me through so much mental and emotional agony. 

I'm so lonely. I can't see myself in any career because I have zero energy and motivation to actually attain one. I just...I'm so angry. Angry that I have to put my blood, sweat, and tears into making a life for myself when I get nothing out of it. Just surviving to suffer.  It's been like this for years. I've been so lonely and isolated that I actually feel insane. 

No man will ever look at me with desire or love. Not the real me. I'm not one of those chicks going through PMS or BDD. I actually am unattractive. I hate that I feel like I have to have a partner or be attractive to be happy. To enjoy living. But it's true. I'm a fat, and pimply with an overbite. It's not helping that I'm a POC surrounded by white people who prefer other white people. I'm desperate and insecure and have no self-esteem. Who tf wants a girl like that?? No one! No one wants me. No one will ever look at me with desire or lust/love.

 I can't give up on picturing the life I want to have. I just want it so badly. And if I can't have it I just don't wanna live anymore. Idc if I sound silly or selfish. I'm getting nowhere in life and life is so painfully boring when I'm not crying in self pity. I'm stuck. I've been stuck for so long. Stagnant. There is no meaning or purpose in my life.

I felt amazing. After some time of dealing with these inmates, I started to relate to the bunch of them. The high majority of them are just normal, 9-5 guys/gals that messed up and wound up here. I felt bad for the lot of them even though they made their own decision&amp;#39;s. After a year here, I had seen a lot of things that have been messing with me. I would lay down and hear things in the middle of the night that would remind me of certain things that had happened. I have been going on some severe depression, caffeine, and nicotine. I have been trying to move on with a different career but has been a challenge with money and some other personal deals. I have been scared for what I&amp;#39;m becoming and what I might do. I hit a new level of depression. I am scared because I came up with a plan on how I&amp;#39;m going to end everything. I told my shift supervisors about all of this and they told me that they would contact a doctor... It&amp;#39;s been 4 days since then and still haven&amp;#39;t heard anything. Does anyone have any ideas? Please share if you do&lt;/p&gt;

Did you think you were doing something dignified when you crushed her skull with a rake? How about when you put her tiny brittle bones into a blender to pulverise them? Or to top it all off, when you accidentally got a hole in the plastic bag with her ashes in it, causing some to fall out, and your solution, your way if ""helping"" was to sweep them up with a dustpan and brush. That's ingrained into my memory. That will never go away. That traumatized me. My lovely sister doesn't even have a body anymore. You just swept her up like a pile of rubbish.*

*You disgust me. It's been nearly two months since the fucking cancer got her and everyday I hate you more. How do you justify incinerating kids? You don't. I don't care if you were heartbroken and apparently cried while you burnt her. You deserve to have that pain. It was so hard to refrain from hitting you and digging my thumb's into your eyes when you swept her up like that. And don't get me started with those tacky memorial gifts, like a ceramic ornament with puppies and some corny quite about heaven. My sister liked cats. And stop saying she's in heaven and with God when you know my mother and I have religious trauma and are atheists. Every time you try to help you make things worse. I wish you'd just die.*

*I hope you know the only reason I haven't knocked you out is because you're a therapist, and my mother has PTSD from the Iraq war. I love her, and I wish she could get better fucking help than you, but since you know her personally and don't cost anything, you'll have to do. As for me, I don't want your ""grief counseling."" I don't even remember my sister for the person she was anymore. I remember the ashes that you spilled onto the floor, or when you put them into that ugly ass urn. That's what I remember now. So if you wanted to cremate her so I could have her powdered bones to ""help me cope with losing her,"" then congratulations. This is what you've done, and I hope you're happy. I nearly with there was a hell, a special kind of hell just for you. You'll never know how much you traumatized me. Every night I wake up screaming thinking about my sister being swept up like that.

,SuicideWatch,"I am 31 years old and I've been miserable for most of my life. I've been in hospitals, I've been in therapy, nothing has helped.

My life consists of working from home, doing pointless bullshit, then watching TV, playing video games and jerking off.

I have never in my life felt love and I also don't think anyone has ever been in love with me. When you're gay, it's easy enough to get random sex but as I am aging I am getting even uglier so that's not gonna last much longer.

I am ugly, fat, diseased, have bad teeth, atrophied muscles, borderline personality disorder, and just unpleasant to be around.

Since I know if you're lonely at 30 you'll be lonely your entire life because your 20s are when you're building your social network, I know that my life will never change for the better. In fact, it is now changing for the worse.

It's incredibly hard to fall asleep. I am hypersensitive to everything, I just can't get comfortable. It takes 3 or 4 hours every night to fall asleep.

I have no friends, I've never been in a relationship, and nothing can change so what's the point? I would have killed myself long ago but I don't want to hurt my parents in that way. It's not their fault they made the wrong decision to keep me. They couldn't know that I'd turn out to be a genetic freak with no redeeming qualities at all. 

So I have about 30 years more of this crap. I guess I could start drinking or doing drugs. Probably drinking, I am not cool enough to know any drug dealers.

I&amp;#39;ve been in hospitals, I&amp;#39;ve been in therapy, nothing has helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life consists of working from home, doing pointless bullshit, then watching TV, playing video games and jerking off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never in my life felt love and I also don&amp;#39;t think anyone has ever been in love with me. When you&amp;#39;re gay, it&amp;#39;s easy enough to get random sex but as I am aging I am getting even uglier so that&amp;#39;s not gonna last much longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am ugly, fat, diseased, have bad teeth, atrophied muscles, borderline personality disorder, and just unpleasant to be around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I know if you&amp;#39;re lonely at 30 you&amp;#39;ll be lonely your entire life because your 20s are when you&amp;#39;re building your social network, I know that my life will never change for the better. In fact, it is now changing for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s incredibly hard to fall asleep. I am hypersensitive to everything, I just can&amp;#39;t get comfortable. It takes 3 or 4 hours every night to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no friends, I&amp;#39;ve never been in a relationship, and nothing can change so what&amp;#39;s the point? I would have killed myself long ago but I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt my parents in that way. It&amp;#39;s not their fault they made the wrong decision to keep me. They couldn&amp;#39;t know that I&amp;#39;d turn out to be a genetic freak with no redeeming qualities at all. &lt;/p&gt;

I am lucky to have a family that loves me, but at the same time I feel like they&amp;#39;re all I have and the only people who care about me, and that if anything were to happen to them that life wouldn&amp;#39;t feel worth living and I&amp;#39;d kill myself anyway. When I was walking into the ocean I noticed I was on the verge of tears and also laughing in a way that I didn&amp;#39;t recognize as myself. And I remember thinking that it was self absorbed of me to assume that my family&amp;#39;s lives would be destroyed without me, that they all have a lot of other people and things that bring them joy. Writing it out I see the hypocrisy. I basically just see myself dying as a movie in my mind on repeat. I&amp;#39;ve been in a depressive episode for a few days and know I need to get my medication readjusted, see a psychiatrist and talk to my therapist again. It just feels like these cycles are gonna go on forever.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I just want to die, it's either she dies or I die. She has never loved me, her abuse has made me traumatized. I don't want to live in the same world as her anymore. I also am sick of living in this world for money and just hoping for that retirement in which probably I'm too old to enjoy anything anyway. 

My mother treats me like an accountant and thinks I'm stealing from her or whatever. I have a job and am earning okay but she always doubt me like I'm a stranger. She is not good at math and so she lets me handle her money.

Anyway, it's more like employee and boss relationship. She always asks about her money and never what I'm feeling, always berates my success. 

She had abused me when I was a child, dragged me down the stairs just because I drew on ""expensive dolls"". Hit me several times and made me feel like I don't deserve anything. She has never apologized to me even if she were wrong while I always have to apologize just because I didn't do this petty thing she wants. I remember when I was young, I just forgot to greet ""goodmorning"" or ""goodnight"" and she would throw a huge fit over it. I felt like I was wrong and dumb for not remembering but now that I'm an adult it's just so unreasonable the way she raised me.

Then I have to take care of her because she raised me because in our culture, you give back to your parents or you're ungrateful bitxh. Everyone says not to leave her but they probably don't want to take care of her. 

Everyone downplays the abuse she gave me because it's an asian thing, everyone has been hit by their parents one time. But mine wasn't at all loving or anything, always just this toxic atmosphere that I have to obey or else. She even hits our dog, what do I expect from her.

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t afford this breakdown now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just shit with exams soon - I cannot afford to think this. But I&amp;#39;ve already been referred to mental health services. I had fun today but now i feel disgusting, drained and very low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish myself that I would make strength and confidence again. I want to know its only the shutty mood and confidence. &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"(Throwaway account (23/M)) I have been struggling with depression, anxiety, ADD, BDD, and OCD for many many years, but I have managed it decently well in the past few years. I was actually in probably one of the best mental states of my life a year ago; that was until I noticed I was losing my hair (plus covid ruining the world, but that's another conversation). My hair has always been one of my greatest features, people used to tell me that all the time. It practically defined my personality. About 8 months ago, I started using minoxidil and finasteride (only two meds FDA approved for growing hair). For a while, I was pretty optimistic because I know that my hair wouldn't regrow overnight. It got a smidge better for a little while, but now it is back to the baseline from 10 months ago, if not worse. All day, every day, its all I can think about. I applied for 15 jobs today (I graduated college last year), and all I could think about the entire day was my hair and how awful I feel about myself. I am constantly check my hair in the mirror and feel like shit, or see myself on snapchat. If im not doing that, im probably reading up about something regarding hair loss in a attempt to feel better about myself. I want to find a way to feel better about this. I NEED to find a way to feel better about this or I fear I will go way off the deep end. This issue has consumed almost every waking hour of my life for the past year; spent doing research on hair loss, researching any potential contributing factors, watching youtube videos, reading articles, spending hours on r/tressless etc. I'm so tired. I would do anything to get my hair back to where it was two years ago. I would trade legit anything. I don't think shaving my head is a viable option for me, I think that would legitimately break my brain and make me much more suicidal, depressed, dissociative, etc. I have a constant thought: if I killed myself today, at least I would still have hair during my funeral. I don't know what to do with myself. I hate how I look and I spend every waking minute thinking about it and feeling the need to stare at myself in the mirror. It is inhibiting my social life, I actively avoid meeting new people and seeing friends as often as I used to (Yes, I am seeing a therapist and yes she knows how much I am struggling with this.)

I quit vaping in February of this year, but I picked it up again when I moved in with a friend by hitting his vape almost daily. I feel like this has contributed to my hair loss and makes me feel like absolute shit. I pledged to quit for good last night and I am praying to sweet jesus that my hair might start to grow back and be healthier (nicotine is a vasoconstrictor, so stopping smoking should help me get more blood flow to my scalp). At the same time, I am really itching for a fix, I just know I really shouldnt and I am trying to quit cold turkey, I fear I might lose more hair if I continue my habit.

I don't know why I am posting here, but I just really REALLY needed to get this off my chest in some way. I'm so fucking tired of everything.

,SuicideWatch,"Background, I'm 28M,  I've been on a cocktail of different medications for mental health stuff. PTSD, Depression, ADHD, Anxiety, etc. When I was at my lowest, I was drinking an obscene amount and had enough of it. I got help and began my journey of trying to get better. My mom had told me she was more than willing to help with my medications and therapy. Both are not cheap as I do not have insurance. I live in Canada so luckily my therapy is covered however as doctors visits have continued the cost of my medication has increased substantially from around 60 bucks to 280.

While sitting in a vehicle with her yesterday, she brought up  the cost of medication and that it was too much for her or my dad to pay which as absolutely false considering I know they make around 300k a year combined. She then told me that I need to talk to my doctor about getting off medication. I had told her alot of the challenges I face mentally stem from abuse as a child and she immediately became defensive and told me I need to get over it, what's in the past stays in the past, etc. She told me my doctor and therapist are both not good for me and that I need to just get over my past. I yelled at her to shut up and stop talking about it but she persisted. She told me nothing about me has changed, nothing about how I feel has changed and I'm still the same as I was pre medication which is the furthest thing from the truth. I've never been better my entire adult life. I gave her the ultimatum of continuing to help me or I can go back to drinking like it did.  She told me ""you can't hang that over my head"" and the conversation came to a lull for another 2 minutes before I arrived at home. When I got out of the vehicle I looked her in the eyes and said ""you have no idea how close you were to planning my funeral several times to my hand, this has been the only thing that has helped me my whole life. If you don't see that, then fuck you"" and with super hulk angry strength i slammed the door. She peeled off before I could get any of my belongings out. 

Luckily my girlfriend was home as I had instantly had a panic attack and was inconsolable for over an hour, nearly hyperventilating until I passed out. I had really contemplated suicide for the next few hours, one of the only things that held me back in the past was devastating my parents but I'm not even sure if that matters now.

,SuicideWatch,"Here I am writing this post after crying for an hour, alone in my university dorm.

A quick rundown of what my life is like: I was always a physically small, shy kid that would get bullied for years and years, because of that, my social skills have suffered tremendously and I find it hard to make strong connections with new people. My dad is a very successful business man that has high expectations of me and I am a university student with a STEM major. 

i've struggled with mental illnesses all my life due to getting bullied everyday for years and not telling anyone, I have a few friends who I could call my ""bestfriends"" who I met back in middle school only because they were getting bullied too ( we literally became friends bc we had that in common) and we've been friends ever since (that was like 8 years ago). They got better at socializing and find it easy to make new friends meanwhile i'm still struggling, I always dreamed of having a fun, social life thats full of friends and supportive people but I dont know whats wrong with me because it seems no matter how hard I try, I always fail to make a strong connection with someone new. 

My major in uni is something that I really really love and is something that I want to associate myself with forever, but I'm about to finish my second year of university and I'm doing so bad, I either fail a class completely or barely pass which is absolutely crushing me because I work so hard and spend hours and hours studying but it seems pointless because I still fail no matter what.

so like the title says, I wish I was never born, I dont want to live anymore, I wish I go to sleep one day and I dont wake up, I wish i get hit by a truck and die, I wish there was a button to press to make everyone forget I existed and kill me instantly.

I'm a failure at socializing, I'm a failure at university, I feel so alone and miserable i'm actually sobbing while typing this. I feel like i'm worth nothing and any success that I do have is only because of my dad's success and not my own effort and abilities.

The thought of killing myself i mean.  it used to scare me because i didn't really wanna die, but lately, that has changed. I just googled on ""quetiapine overdose"" which is some medication a get, but according to the internet, thats pretty much impossible to OD on. Which is good i guess... I've pretty much stopped talking to all of my friends, and they dont really contact me neither. I've got a brother who knows that my mental state isnt always good.  He insist on me talking to him about it, but everytime i do, i can see the hurt and frustraion in him. One time he told me to go ahead and do it if thats what i wanted, he regretted it right after, but i can't help but feel thats what would be best for him and everyone else around me. I lost my father to cancer back in 2015, i smoked alot of weed back then, and while he was laying on his deathbed all i wanted to do was go home and smoke instead of being there for him. I regret that so much. But at least his death gave me the shove i needed so i could quit smoking and finish me education. I was really close with my mother, see had alot of mental problems too and drank alot, and when i finished my education she got sick and got into a nursing home (she wasnt old, it was just a place that could help her) so she could recover. I had planned to go there with my brother and aunt to see her, but i called it of at the last second. I couple of days later she was put in a hospital because she wasnt doing to good. The next day she went into a coma and never woke up again (we believe that she might have OD on her meds, but the doctor wasnt sure). I can't help but feel like a might have been able to do something about it if I hadnt pussied out... I can still see her lying in the hospital bed with her mouth open. I just feel like a piece of shit who's never gonna amount to anything and end up like my mother. I'm just hurting the people around me and giving them things to worry about. I think it would all be better for them in the long run, if they didnt have to worry about me.

I lost my father to cancer back in 2015, i smoked alot of weed back then, and while he was laying on his deathbed all i wanted to do was go home and smoke instead of being there for him. I regret that so much. But at least his death gave me the shove i needed so i could quit smoking and finish me education. I was really close with my mother, see had alot of mental problems too and drank alot, and when i finished my education she got sick and got into a nursing home (she wasnt old, it was just a place that could help her) so she could recover. I had planned to go there with my brother and aunt to see her, but i called it of at the last second. I couple of days later she was put in a hospital because she wasnt doing to good. The next day she went into a coma and never woke up again (we believe that she might have OD on her meds, but the doctor wasnt sure). I can&amp;#39;t help but feel like a might have been able to do something about it if I hadnt pussied out... I can still see her lying in the hospital bed with her mouth open. I just feel like a piece of shit who&amp;#39;s never gonna amount to anything and end up like my mother. I&amp;#39;m just hurting the people around me and giving them things to worry about. I think it would all be better for them in the long run, if they didnt have to worry about me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry about the incoherent babble i just wrote what came to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if im gonna come back to this thread so dont worry about leaving any comments here.&lt;br/&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I apologize in advance for this disorganized rant. 

So I've never struggled with suicidal thoughts as much as i have right now. I nearly died from dehydration due to me neglecting self care recently due to severe anxiety, and when I get anxiety i tend to feel paralyzed and hopeless. I don't even have much of an appetite and i didn't even realize i was so severely dehydrated because i didn't even feel thirst. My heart was skipping beats and my legs were swelling and my skin was strangely elastic, it was honestly horrifying and i didn't want to die actually and experienced terrifying delirium and psychosis like thoughts which i read happens with dehydration . I was also using THC 24/7 and developed a bit of an addiction to it, and i realize that made things worse for me although it helped temporarily with anxiety. I've dealt with chronic pain of all kinds on and off since 16 now 21 and I've had severe anxiety and fear over it and treated it through a variety of means which did help by seeing chiropractors and different people(but i could never get full relief and would literally end up in all kinds of pain after sitting in a position for more then an hour, i would feel frustrated that i was so young dealing with back pain and nerve pain).  In an extremely anxious state i bought something to help with my jaw pain online because i was frustrated that i wasn't getting results i was satisfied with  from different therapies(which was a dumb decision), but i think it made everything so much worse.  And i feel INTENSE brain fog and ive been feeling my arms and legs losing sensation and just bad pains throughout my body. Doctors don't know why and chiropractic isn't helping anymore like it used to. I'm terrified of living info a future where i get physically and mentally worse, and I've felt extreme brain fog and limb weakness for weeks. I don't have much of a hope of getting cured as I've seen so many doctors and people, and i have a ton of guilt and self hatred because i unintentionally made myself worse and i didn't trust my gut feelings but instead gave into anxiety. I'm angry and sad that I've had these anxious tendencies and hypochondriac like behaviors my whole life, along with actual chronic pain from 17 that made me stop a lot of things I've loved doing.  I've realized that hypochondria is a mild form of psychosis as well so now i wonder if I've had more severe mental problems then I've previously thought. Also I've been battling so much religious trauma for being gay and i feel so restricted and trapped in my body and mind and situation  and like I'm floating in a fog 24/7. I believe that a lot of my physical pain came from trauma as well. My spine is basically messed up on an x-ray and at the age of 21 i have a super straight neck curve with thinning discs and my hands tremor, so I'm not imagining the pain and symptoms i have, but i realize the anxiety about it makes it worse, and now it's actually more concerning due to me buying a mouth piece to help my jaw pain that i never actually got formally diagnosed with. I want to drop dead at times and just desire instant death, but i also don't want to hurt my family or friends around me(all my friends are moving away and i feel like a completely different person), and I'm scared of what happens next if i do decide to end it. I believe in an afterlife and God, but i believe suicide would just make me either have to repeat everything all over again, or stunt my growth, or put me in an even more hellish state. I'm scared to live, scared to die, have moments of happiness , and deep moments of sadness. I've been in an intense brain fog state 24/7 for months, and also dealing with headaches and strange pain that I'm having trouble resolving either from my accidental dehydration, or my messed up spine or both. I've had hopes and dreams to go to college and travel and do things, but the jobs i want require you to be mentally and physically healthy and i feel like i can barely walk sometimes because my legs feel so heavy. I've always been sensitive and terrified of life and making mistakes, but also had times of great excitement and motivation in the past, but now everything seems hopeless and i feel like i have an invisible illness that no one can help me with, and I've lost all joy in the previous passions and goals I've had. So I'm just going day by day and not even thinking about the future cause i don't even see myself living past 30 and i don't want to right now. I have moments of happiness interspersed with the anxiety/depression/pain, but for months now there is this constant overwhelming sense of hopelessness, numbness, sadness, and physical pain that is minor most of the time but gets much worse at random times, and the brain fog from my jaw discomfort is soooo overwhelming and i can't even think. I just find it overwhelming existing in this mortal flesh of emotional and physical discomfort. I'm not even sure how to help myself anymore as the therapies i used before aren't helping anymore. I thought life was supposed to be fun and we were supposed to get better overtime, but I've gotten worse in every single way and i realize i have myself to blame for my mistakes due to anxiety , and i can't stand existing with myself and living with this physical and mental situation. So that's my rant of the day lol. I also forgot to mention ive been battling severe social anxiety lately as well and am very sensitive to nearly everything. I wish I could be emotionally stable like other people i see around me (although i don't know their inner thoughts ). I fantasize about dehydrating myself again, drowning myself, or hanging myself. But these feelings come with an overwhelming sense of guilt and self hatred because my family does care about me which I'm thankful for, although they are responsible for so much of my emotional trauma. I also do believe in a higher power, and when i was dehydrated severely there were some events that happened that confirmed my belief in a higher power, but i feel so confused and upset to have these anxious tendencies and physical things.",t2_18qfypbo,False,,0,False,"21 Hypochondriac with chronic pain, severe anxiety/depression, and feeling lost.",[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,,False,t3_ouv2zx,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},2a7b5518-8e45-11e5-a506-0ed10b342609,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,modmsg,[],{},,True,,1627683024.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I apologize in advance for this disorganized rant. &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch," Hello everyone,

I am asking for help with this situation:

I  have met a young woman on the internet, she seems like a really nice  person... unfortunately she is struggling with anorexia and a number of  other mental health issues I cannot even begin to list in full.

She  is 22 years old, she lives in the Ukraine. She currently weighs 22.5  kgs (=49.6 lbs), but she has told me that her weight was once as low as  17.8 kgs (=39.2 lbs). As recently as a couple of months ago, she weighed  19 kgs (=41.9 lbs). After that she was admitted to a hospital, where  she was forced to gain the amount she weighs now and was dismissed from  the hospital not too long ago. The best I can tell, she has struggled  with anorexia for around 6 years now. She is tired of it. She tells me  she is still attempting to lose weight, but while at one point she did  it for the thinness itself, at this point she just wants herself to die  trying. She values herself and her life as a negative (or at best a 0)  to society. She repeatedly told me she isn't even worth the effort she  puts into starving to death and that she never even could kill herself  properly using this method as she ""has no self-control"". This is the  only part of her messages i regard as a white lie, since she clearly has  already arrived at life-threatening weights.

Her  family either doesn't care for her or doesn't understand her problem,  it is probably a combination of the two (she has told me both things),  so she cannot turn to them. The best part of this horrible story is that  she is not completely dismissive of seeking mental health support,  though she has told me that she has a bad experience with the local  psychologist of the small town she inhabits. She would probably require a  bit of convincing to actually call/visit a professional. I have  searched for ukrainian mental health hotlines she could call, but the  best I could tell, all of them are either reserved for the veterans of  the war in eastern Ukraine or not toll-free (she is from a poor  background, she has just enough money to support herself, or maybe not  even that much. She tells me she hasn't got any money on her phone for  calls). I haven't asked but she probably does not speak English, only  Russian and Ukrainian, I am communicating with her through an online  translation site, most of the time, the message comes across.

What can I do now?

If  you can, please leave advice in the comments (or message me, that's  fine too). Feel free to ask for more details if you think it helps. Any  offers of help are greatly appreciated.

,SuicideWatch,"I recently made it to 26 and as the more time passes, the more I realize I did not expect to live this long. I've tried to think of a future where I have a career, family, and take my meds consistently. A timeline where I don't feel so alone all the time, or like a bad person, or even less broken. None of them feel real. Instead, I am greeted by the feeling that this is either purgatory or my death should happen soon. I wish that I'd been successful in my serious attempt from 5 years ago. Then I wouldn't have had to deal with all of my friends abandoning me. I wouldn't have to feel this alone. I wouldn't be consumed by these thoughts to the point I cannot focus on my work. I would have limited the wake of my devastation. I wouldn't be fighting with providers to get the medication I need. I wouldn't be here, alive, awake today, and that sounds like a better reality. Maybe I won't make it to 27. That's always been another thought. As much as I want to feel loved, at home, and to support others, I'd rather leave this all behind for the great eternal darkness that awaits us all. 

When I was younger, one of the many beliefs of my suicide, was that I was meant to die to force others to connect to each other. That my purpose was to help, leave, and cause the people dealing with it to come together. As that pops up more and more each day, I don't feel that mindset is off. If I had a funeral, it would force my friends to see each other again. Maybe they would see it as a need to reach out to each other more often. Maybe they would hang out more as they attempted to navigate their pain if they feel anything at all. Maybe my family would check on each other more often as well. It feels wrong to think my death would have any impact on those around me. I'm not as ignorant to assume they would have a party, but that I mattered enough to them for this to be lasting doesn't seem real either. Maybe this is my personal hell. I have no pleasure in what I do and live to get through the day-to-day. I have been done with waking up tomorrow for most of my life. I'm too bad at killing myself to find a way to get it right. Maybe I should try harder. 

I am replaceable. I am insignificant. My place in the lives of those around me and the world could not matter less. Though others say they care about me, I do not care about me. I don't want to be here and have spent my time attempting to build enough goodwill for this incredibly selfish act. Why is it so hard to not be here? Why do I keep waking up?

,SuicideWatch,"For 6 years I've convinced myself that it's not my fault. It's the education system, society, my family, etc. I kept saying that what I did was okay because I was scared and it was for my mental health. Never really got better and in fact it went worse.

How could I betray these people? They want nothing but the best for me and I ruined it. I ruined their expectations, their wishes for me but most of all I've ruined my future. I don't know how to get back up from this. In all of those 6 years I had to keep a lie every single day and I feared every single second that passes by thinking I'd be found out.

Now think about that.... I'm walking in and immediately all my depression and anxiety meds are taken from me. Now, I'm in an ER so I'm gonna see a doctor and they will make sure I have what I need while I'm here right?..... Guess again.

So now I finally get told where I'm going... And then you have to wait for transportation. Do you know who transports patients who are under lockdown observation?  The police.
Want to guess what I have to put on before we go for this exciting ride? Noooo not clothes.... I'm still mostly neeked sans my shoes which no longer have laces.... No I have to be shackled...

I don't have the energy to kill myself. Wish I could, but I don't want to upset and traumatise my family over my death. 

Growing up, I have a feeling that I will not live past 30+ years old, and that feeling has been around since when I was 10. Why? During my early childhood, I witnessed my parents arguing a lot over financial issues, mom almost murdering my dad with a knife. We weren't wealthy or well-off back then when my parents had me. 

Now that I looked back, I wished my parents learnt to focus on their finances than giving birth to me. Not to mention, I have a disability as well which is Autism. Both of them refused to believe about my disability from a doctor (Which has a stigma in Asian cultures.) And I end up wondering why the fuck I was so different from the rest of the kids for the rest of my childhood. 

I suffered from social awkwardness, wondering why were people shocked at my odd responses, being bullied, not knowing how to healthily cope, or accidentally annoy the people around me because I didn't hear them clearly for the first time. 

How do I cope these days? Most of the time, I cope by watching gore videos to deal with these thoughts. Listening to Black Metal, Death Metal, whatever.

,SuicideWatch,"I don't even know where to begin.

I'm so unhealthy in mind, body and spirit that I feel so trapped. Even the most basic things like hygiene have been a problem for so long that they stress me out to say nothing of having a job and having long term plans. I just subsist here relying on people who now hate my presence and tell me so everyday. I hate my dependency, but I don't know how to handle things myself.

On top of not being able to handle my own life, I cannot stop thinking about the world. I cannot stop thinking about all the hatred, ignorance and power-tripping involved in the operation of the world. We're killing the planet and no one is actually doing anything substantial to stop it. The concept of truth and the foundations of knowledge have been eroded to the point where everything has become this Nietzschean competition to be or not to be on the basis of your very own rules.

And I cannot make my own rules/meaning/goals. How can you strive for any dreams when your ""nose"" for happiness is gone? How do you move towards anything at all and commit to anything when everything normal and necessary in this world wears you out to the point of wanting to leave after five seconds?

 One day just slips into the next. I pass the time with passive activities and never leave the house. All my efforts to be employed have involved me quitting due to the stress of not being able to handle normal life. And I hate myself for it. I hate myself for my weakness. I hate myself because people taught me to hate myself. 

I lost my will to live over the last ten years. My self-respect is gone and there's not any fertile part of my being in which something like self-compassion can grow. People die for lack of love; you can wither from hating yourself. I've withered through my 20s and now my 30s are here for me to shrivel out of existence in. Will it be my liver or my heart that goes from my unhealthiness? 

No, I just want things to be quick now. I've cut myself off from people. My family is sick of me, even the supportive ones don't know what to do. I don't blame them. Therapy doesn't help. Drugs don't help. You need something to keep going, to push back against all the grayness in the world.

I don't have a part of me that wants to push back. I just want to be like dust in the wind or an echo that fades or a memory which becomes unremembered. 

I hate myself. I hate this world.Why do I have to hold on? I can't hold on for others. And looking at this planet, what good is there being alive when you're just fodder for a destructive cancer of unchecked economic activity? What's the point of making compassionate suicide so hard. 

It's not like something acute happened. I became an adult and I've failed. I want out. I want a mutual divorce from this life without having to pretend superficially in hope. I can't believe in hope. Hope doesn't take root in me.

I want to let go. I just want there to be an easy way to let go and be done with all of it. All the failure. All the health and mental problems. All the feelings of stress and shame swelling up in my body and forming the background state of my existence. I can't take this anymore. 

Other people can have the space, resources and energy I take up with my continued existence. This is a party I didn't plan and it's not one I want to stay at just for the sake of the thing itself. As for me, I just don't care. I never really did. And I don't know how to care or to learn to care.

Nothing gets my jazzed. Nothing gets me through. I can barely focus on an activity and don't get anything out of things emotionally or ""motivationally"". Lots of this is because I don't try hard enough (or is this my parent's talking in me?).

It's all been stuck deep into me that I don't deserve to be happy and that I make myself unhappy. If I make myself un-happy and can't change, then why not unmake myself. Continuing just seems like a lost cause which will bring down most of all the more loving and supportive people in my life until they hate me just as much as my parents. Call this an apoptosis of the individual human as opposed to a cell; I know I am dysfunctional so this is the process of limiting my effect on everything through self-destruction.

That's it. That's all I want to say. Life goes on and on too long for someone like me. I'm happy that other people find meaning here and can grow and can put aside the things they cannot control to ""keep on keeping on"" and otherwise find the joy in things. I just don't. Nothing has helped, and I always destroy any tiny bit of progress I can make for myself in the space of three weeks by falling back into terrible habits for spans of months to years.

I'm tired people. I'm so tired of having so little to show for myself, no ideas on how to mange to get to get my shit together and no energy to change.

I tried to kill myself 3 times when I was 18/19. Couldn't go through it because of the love that I have for my parents. Also I was afraid that I would go to hell. 

So I tried to get improved. I have done everything I can, but it still the same. I still live with my parents, and don't have any skill an adult should have. I'm not allowed to go out alone. I don't know how to handle adult problems. Other than one freelance writing job, which I quit after 2 months, I never done anything other than getting a bachelors and a masters degree from low rank universities. I didn't try to get enrolled in better universities, because all of them require to sit for an interview and with my anxiety and panic attacks it is impossible. 

Because of a significant figure in my life I was brought up in a very sheltered household and I'm still like that. 

My siblings had a different life. One of them is doing a phd in a reputable uni and she's only 22. And other one is a senior software engineer and he's getting married next month. Both of them have really good personalities and social skills. They are fluent in English too, which is highly valued in my country. I'm suck at everything.

Plus I'm gay. And I live in a homophobic country. I don't know how, but I found a quarantine gf. She lives far away. We've never met irl. Just video calls. I can't go there, because I don't know how to drive or take a bus. Also I'm not allowed. She said she will come to meet me once the lockdown is over. 

She wants to go abroad. But I don't have any skill a country would find useful. Even my degrees are useless in other countries.

Since my brother is getting married and he can move out from house. But because I'm gay I might have to live in this house forever, with the person I mentioned. She's not my mom. My parents are good people. But they were always too busy to notice the abuse.

I was mentally abused my whole life and I was sexually assaulted this year. 

I'm a coward. I don't want to die. If things got at least a bit better I will never do it. If things stayed the same, I'm definitely going to die at 32. I picked 32, because astrologers (I don't believe astrology that much, but it's the only hope I have) say that my life will improve by 32.

,SuicideWatch,"TW: transphobia, suicidal thoughts

The way my parents tell me that they won't support me no matter what. That I'm ""unnatural"" and when I say why don't you learn about it they just say it doesn't concern us so we won't, they don't want to learn nor support and then the it's just a phase. You just got caught up in this thing about you being trans and aren't willing to listen to anyone who tells you otherwise. IT'S MY FUCKIN IDENTITY DAMN IT. HOW THE FUCK CAN OTHERS DEFINE IT FOR ME. I'm having suicidal thoughts even while on anti-depressants. I don't trust anyone. I feel like I have to choose between whether I die inside everyday or just die.

I wanna transition real badly or I can wait 4-6 years to do it but then I'm afraid I won't look good and further I can't concentrate on studies very well with other stuff on my mind, it was the same when I was in school I didn't even touch my books even for finals I was escaping to the max. Now I know who I am.

Nope I don't see a future for myself as a man, I just am not, why can't they try to understand me. Of course I can understand them all they care about is the society, I did too and I got my answer, either no one gives a fuck or else haters and ignorant assholes. Do not mind them and we will be cool.

If I didn't drop out due to depression I would have gotten a job next year perhaps. Wish I knew about myself earlier so I could plan what to do.

There is a very high possibility that my life will end in suicide, if not now then a couple years or a decade later.

For now I could leave my home but I will have no job to do.

They don't understand how better it would be for my mental health and even studies and I can make real friends and I can finally live as myself if I transition right now. If I transition later I won't have any method of making new friends if the old ones are transphobic.

&lt;p&gt;The way my parents tell me that they won&amp;#39;t support me no matter what. That I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;unnatural&amp;quot; and when I say why don&amp;#39;t you learn about it they just say it doesn&amp;#39;t concern us so we won&amp;#39;t, they don&amp;#39;t want to learn nor support and then the it&amp;#39;s just a phase. You just got caught up in this thing about you being trans and aren&amp;#39;t willing to listen to anyone who tells you otherwise. IT&amp;#39;S MY FUCKIN IDENTITY DAMN IT.

,SuicideWatch,"I don't remember much of my childhood aside from the traumatic events that took place during high school. I was different, enjoyed theatre, musicals, sewing and cooking.

As a male in the late 90's and early 00's, that was enough. But put towards the fact that I was brought up to stand up for what is right, and what wasn't. I stood up to my bullies. This lead to daily beatings and emotional persecution. 

The worst happened when I was knocked unconscious with a bat. I was placed in the schools sick bay, unattended until I woke up to my mother and grandfather. We changed schools, but it was too late. The straight A student was gone, and I would do and mask anything to fit in.

I learnt how to be a 'man' from my peers. I'd lost interest in everything before, and found refuge in PC gaming. This became my life of escape, for 20 years. I held jobs down at a time for 3 years at most, with more time off work in-between finding work again.

Who I was became lost and muddied, I withdrew from family. My parents divorced. My grandparents passed. I'd attempted suicide a number of times, unsuccessfully. I'd tried the route of medication. Never found, trusted or openly spoke to professionals who always seemed, disinterested and that my tribulations were simplistic and unworthy of anything more than the top 10 recommendations for depression treatment seemingly starting with how to for dummies. To be honest, I don't trust, nor like people at all. And the professionals are people.

Cowardice, don't do it for you loved ones and the impact it will have on them, I'd heard it all. But at what point can I start living and loving life. When all I did was live for them, deep down in my heart I know what I want. Living an empty life, vs ending it.

My fathers family hail from the UK, and he won't leave me to be with them. I have a friend, whom I met online some years ago. But in the 6 months of late, she is so worn down trying to help me and keep my head above water, it has permanently changed the happy go lucky woman she was. And I can't live with that anymore. I can't do what was done to me, intentional or not. I will not stand by and abide the burden I've become. My father, copped a lot of my abuse and hatred during my removal from society.

I tried again a few months ago to see a professional. All she could rule, was that I am now agoraphobic, chronic anxiety and wanted me to go on medication again. Medication tuned me out and turned me into an apathetic zombie. I won't do that again. 

I no longer feel connected to any part of society. I no longer feel love, or loved. I only see an abyss, which I belong in. If I could trade my life for someone else's, I would.

I've yearned for peace, and an escape from the prison and hell that is my mind for decades. I'm no longer capable of fighting this, and truth be told, I don't want to.

*Nietzsche said the bravest thing a man can do is to gather his loved ones around him and take his own life before time and disease have a chance to lay him waste. If one cannot live ferociously, why live? The only real question is: Should we wait until life has proven to us how disappointing it is? Or should we cheerfully charge toward whatever awaits us on the other side of death, presuming it cannot be worse than this? If one studies the rich and successful one cannot help recognizing their path leads not to happiness. But apologies to those who will miss me. Wouldn't you rather see me free-falling among the stars than chained to a life which only evokes my disdain or even worse, my apathy?*

I wish I could come up with something heartfelt, original and inspirational. My mind is clouded with thoughts of escape, and nothing else. I'm too far gone, and I'm at peace with that. There is just one thing left to do.

I was different, enjoyed theatre, musicals, sewing and cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a male in the late 90&amp;#39;s and early 00&amp;#39;s, that was enough. But put towards the fact that I was brought up to stand up for what is right, and what wasn&amp;#39;t. I stood up to my bullies. This lead to daily beatings and emotional persecution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst happened when I was knocked unconscious with a bat. I was placed in the schools sick bay, unattended until I woke up to my mother and grandfather. We changed schools, but it was too late. The straight A student was gone, and I would do and mask anything to fit in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learnt how to be a &amp;#39;man&amp;#39; from my peers. I&amp;#39;d lost interest in everything before, and found refuge in PC gaming. This became my life of escape, for 20 years. I held jobs down at a time for 3 years at most, with more time off work in-between finding work again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who I was became lost and muddied, I withdrew from family. My parents divorced. My grandparents passed. I&amp;#39;d attempted suicide a number of times, unsuccessfully. I&amp;#39;d tried the route of medication. Never found, trusted or openly spoke to professionals who always seemed, disinterested and that my tribulations were simplistic and unworthy of anything more than the top 10 recommendations for depression treatment seemingly starting with how to for dummies. To be honest, I don&amp;#39;t trust, nor like people at all. And the professionals are people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cowardice, don&amp;#39;t do it for you loved ones and the impact it will have on them, I&amp;#39;d heard it all. But at what point can I start living and loving life. When all I did was live for them, deep down in my heart I know what I want. Living an empty life, vs ending it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fathers family hail from the UK, and he won&amp;#39;t leave me to be with them. I have a friend, whom I met online some years ago. But in the 6 months of late, she is so worn down trying to help me and keep my head above water, it has permanently changed the happy go lucky woman she was. And I can&amp;#39;t live with that anymore. I can&amp;#39;t do what was done to me, intentional or not. I will not stand by and abide the burden I&amp;#39;ve become. My father, copped a lot of my abuse and hatred during my removal from society.&lt;/p&gt;

My entire life is going downhill since i started highschool. Im getting bad grades in all of my classes and im constantly being made fun of by my family for being in modified classes and every day im being built up just to get teared down by my parents. Just today I was trying to talk to my mom about my health which was a stupid idea by a stupid person my mom is emotionally and sometimes physically abusive i was talking to her about how im overweight and if i should go to the gym since im 13. And she starts screaming at me about how i have no confidence and im useless and has told me to go and die multiple times and i go to school thinking it will be an escape from home but boy was i mistaken at school im made fun of for being stupid and dumb. I came home today with bruises but haven't told anyone. ive started saving up money to move out when im 16. But its getting unbearable sometimes i think my parents are getting better and nicer and i start to talk to them about myself and they call me ungrateful and tell me they wished i was never born and I have an older sister and they treat her like a princess and buy whatever she wants while i barely get the bare necessity's for school and to live. I dont know where im going to go when i move out and i know theyre going to try and stop me. On multiple occasions they made me think as if I was in the wrong and on top of that my dad screams at me daily for my grades but doesnt help me. I got a tutor and she is nice but my family is just trying to break me down and im sick of it. Im constantly in yelling matches with my parents until they hit me where i go into my room and I dont have any escapes from reality like videogames. I have my own laptop for school but when I get home its taken away unless i have homework. Even then im supervised everything i do. I only get out of the house when its for something theyre making me do or hell will happen they talk to me like im some sort of idiot I once had fractured two of my fingers on my dominant hand and they said i was faking and made do work until i was begging to be taken to the doctor until my fingers had swelled up so big i could barely move them. I have been made to do so much work for my sister as she is in their words ""The best child I could have ever wished for."" And frankly i just want to leave. And I have thought about suicide multiple times but I cant because i am a muslim and so is my family. I do not know what i am going to do when i turn 16 but i can just only hope for a new start. When i started highschool I thought it would be a fresh start for me but it was the complete opposite. I gained weight and was made fun of even my sports teacher has made fun of me multiple times. The only subject i liked was science because my science teacher was a nice women who actually liked me and i excelled in science but she soon changed teaching science to art and now im stuck with an old women who loves failing people and humiliating me specifically.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm 17, things have just been so unbearable for the past few months. my first boyfriend who was genuinely a gem and who I loved so much left me and not even 2 weeks after found someone else. I still talk to him and he insists I'm still the most wonderful person he's met but it's breaking me apart having to think about all this shit so much. I could cut contact with him but it's too hard to decide. I wish he was a piece of shit and I wish I could hate him but he wants to try to help and it's tearing me apart. I've been so close to suicide too many times in the past couple of months too, and I've been self harming, not too severely but regularly.

it also doesn't help that I lost most of my friends while I went up into sixth form. I've been sat in silence through most of it and I haven't been in since early June because of how far from functional I am. 

my parents love me and are trying their best to help me but we can't get anything done. counselling hasn't been particularly useful and it's going to take months to get the chance for a diagnosis or antidepressants. my dad lost his job so I don't want to be a financial burden also in these hard times.

I feel so ungrateful because I've had nothing particularly traumatic happen, but I just can't seem to find any reason to live. I'll have good moments but it drops so far back every time after. I didn't sleep last night. I can't get comfortable and I just feel so close to finally running away and killing myself I feel like I should just do it.

evidently I'm suffering with some kind of mental illness. I haven't been diagnosed with anything so I'm unsure as to what but I get so fucking scared so constantly that everyone I love will leave me. ever since I was maybe 5 or 6, friends have left me and it's affected me more than I feel it does with others. when I was around 9, my only friend left me and I stood crying in the kitchen with a knife clutched to my chest. I didn't do anything but I wanted to die. I've had so many friends just turn on me or leave and now my relationship with someone who I trusted and adored so much failed because of my stupid fucking mental state. he found it stressful because he wanted to make me feel better but couldn't, and because of the distance which obviously contributed to both of our struggles and I just feel like such a burden to everyone. I suppose it's ""good"" that it's over because it obviously wasn't healthy but I just want to kill myself. I feel completely unlovable and it hurts so much how quickly I was replaced. but he's still here for me and it's so hard to know what to do.

I don't know if I believe I'll ever allow myself to love anyone like that again. and I'm scared to trust anyone even more than ever. but that just makes it so hard to justify continuing living. 

I have supportive people around me and I know I do but I just want the agony to stop. and I don't want to burden anyone. nobody will worry about me if I'm dead. I understand that ""it can get better"" and ""lots of people get out of it"" but lots of people also don't. I'm terrified.

I still talk to him and he insists I&amp;#39;m still the most wonderful person he&amp;#39;s met but it&amp;#39;s breaking me apart having to think about all this shit so much. I could cut contact with him but it&amp;#39;s too hard to decide. I wish he was a piece of shit and I wish I could hate him but he wants to try to help and it&amp;#39;s tearing me apart. I&amp;#39;ve been so close to suicide too many times in the past couple of months too, and I&amp;#39;ve been self harming, not too severely but regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it also doesn&amp;#39;t help that I lost most of my friends while I went up into sixth form. I&amp;#39;ve been sat in silence through most of it and I haven&amp;#39;t been in since early June because of how far from functional I am. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my parents love me and are trying their best to help me but we can&amp;#39;t get anything done. counselling hasn&amp;#39;t been particularly useful and it&amp;#39;s going to take months to get the chance for a diagnosis or antidepressants. my dad lost his job so I don&amp;#39;t want to be a financial burden also in these hard times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel so ungrateful because I&amp;#39;ve had nothing particularly traumatic happen, but I just can&amp;#39;t seem to find any reason to live. I&amp;#39;ll have good moments but it drops so far back every time after. I didn&amp;#39;t sleep last night. I can&amp;#39;t get comfortable and I just feel so close to finally running away and killing myself I feel like I should just do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;evidently I&amp;#39;m suffering with some kind of mental illness. I haven&amp;#39;t been diagnosed with anything so I&amp;#39;m unsure as to what but I get so fucking scared so constantly that everyone I love will leave me. ever since I was maybe 5 or 6, friends have left me and it&amp;#39;s affected me more than I feel it does with others. when I was around 9, my only friend left me and I stood crying in the kitchen with a knife clutched to my chest. I didn&amp;#39;t do anything but I wanted to die. I&amp;#39;ve had so many friends just turn on me or leave and now my relationship with someone who I trusted and adored so much failed because of my stupid fucking mental state. he found it stressful because he wanted to make me feel better but couldn&amp;#39;t, and because of the distance which obviously contributed to both of our struggles and I just feel like such a burden to everyone.

We are still on good terms, but the guilt has just been building up to the point that i have written af few pages Incase I commit suicide. My mood has been swinging immensely and i have used biking as a way to get my minde to a better place, but as soon i relax again the guilt builds up again and i just want it to end.

I&amp;#39;m scared to tell people who are close to me about it, because when I think about their problems mine feel so miniscule, yet I can&amp;#39;t escape the thoughts of dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was depressed (diagnosed) ever since I can remember myself. I was also selfish, lacking empathy, I was hurting people. My partner of 4 years left me and it&amp;#39;s been 5 years since then, I think about them all the time and can&amp;#39;t handle the thought of bringing anyone else into my life. I changed my circle of friends a lot, I can&amp;#39;t commit, I distance myself and leave people who for some reason like me and try to keep me close and then feel shitty when new people don&amp;#39;t really care about me. I&amp;#39;ve been to therapy and abandoned my treatment 3 times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I learned of all the pain and inconviniences I&amp;#39;ve caused the karma decided to finally punish me for being such a worthless human, and my body can&amp;#39;t handle my disgusting selfish dellusional mind. I&amp;#39;ve been cutting myself for years, and scars are healing so badly, I have no room on my body and have to wear jeans and sleeves in 30 degrees celcius. I&amp;#39;ve gained weight again and my body looks horrible with all the drastic changes I&amp;#39;ve been putting it through. I have constant back pains, I sleep most of the day, but it&amp;#39;s nightmares. My health is getting worse and worse. I don&amp;#39;t feel happiness anymore and my hobbies became a chore.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dog was old and became so sick, I had to get her euthenized. I was holding her the entire time and saw her last breath and her last heartbeat. I thought I&amp;#39;ll get over it, but I didn&amp;#39;t, I&amp;#39;m weeping and bawling just thinking about it. The only creature that really needed me here on earth died.

,SuicideWatch,"Towards the end of 2017, I was fired from my job for what I view was a personal conflict with my boss and while I took it hard, I was able to bounce back pretty quickly. I also bought a van and traveled across the country for about 4-6 weeks. 

For the next couple of years, I continued to travel during the winters for 6 weeks or so at a time and can say without a doubt that I never felt more present, alive and happy. I bought a pickup truck and built a bed in the back and traveled all over the US and Baja with my dog. 

At the end of 2019, I quit an ongoing freelance role I had to take on a different freelance role which paid more but was less fulfilling and more corporate. I didn't enjoy it at all and started it as I was preparing for another winter of travels. About halfway through my contract (which was supposed to just be three months) I basically stopped doing the work and stopped communicating. That was in mid-January 2020.

Little did I know what was around the corner... by the time COVID hit, I didn't have any steady freelance work and I never would have assumed that the government would offer unemployment to self employed people and freelancers, so I ended up taking a job as a delivery driver for Amazon. I had been talking with a friend about listing my house for sale by March, but by then, it seemed like the whole world came to a stop and we didn't go through with listing my house. 

Not only was I judged poorly by people in my professional world for being perceived as back-sliding in my personal and professional life, but taking that job ended up screwing up my unemployment benefits. I was eventual approved for the pandemic unemployment assistance program and could have been making $800/week on unemployment and traveling during that time and having the best time of my life, instead, I took a wage job and was miserable.

Then in July of last year, I got my girlfriend pregnant... 4 weeks after we first met. I didn't feel capable and confident considering my depression, my wavering commitment to a career, the fact that I was not even making enough money to support myself and a child, and so on. We talked about getting an abortion, but we bailed on our Planned Parenthood appointment at the last minute. I felt like if we went through with it, I would finally actually commit to selling my house for good this time and then go travel full time and be happy. I had actually purchased a van I planned to convert into a little DIY RV right before her and I met. 

Then even more... a side project I started with two other people two years ago was taking off, and I was doing the same thing... flaking out, losing interest, struggling with depression and money. Eventually, last summer as I'm driving an Amazon van, they started taking on new work without telling me. In January, they formed an LLC and rented an office space and didn't even tell me until after they did it. I haven't communicated with either of them in the last several months. 

Fast forward to now... I sold my project van in February and said that I was giving up that dream. I cycled through a couple other jobs over the winter,  but did end up getting another salaried job where I'm more or less back up to where I should be financially. And then we had our baby in March, just four weeks after I started the new job. She's very sweet and incredibly beautiful. We get comments and compliments all the time about how beautiful she is. I felt like after we had decided to go through with having the baby, I'd finally ""man up"" and shack up with my girlfriend and commit to being a family man. That didn't happen. We broke up in May and have been co-parenting since. 

Right now I'm in nowhere Montana staying in a yurt for a week while baby and her mom are back home. I started writing this post around 5:30 a.m. local time as the sun started rising. My boss (who is amazing and one of the kindest, nicest bosses I've ever had) is letting me take the time for a working vacation, so I'm only working half days and then go out hiking or exploring. I'm finally enjoying myself again after a year of acute and dangerous depression and I'm not sure I even want to go home. There's a part of me that's thinking maybe I should just ""disappear"" and turn my back on my life back in Chicago. But all I know right now is that I regret not following my intuition and my heart by selling my house, committing to freelance work, getting unemployment and then starting a new life of adventure and fulfillment on the road. 

It's really hard... I don't want to abandon my daughter but I know that as soon as I get back home, I'm going to feel depressed and miserable again. I just wish so badly that I had followed my heart and left Chicago and my friends and colleagues on good terms when I had the chance, instead, I stayed and floundered and lost friends, lost career opportunities, went into debt, started a family I wasn't prepared for, and suppressed my dreams and my heart even more.

I’ve been in so much pain I think I am dying but I keep waking up to the same hell every day. For the past 6 months I’ve been bedridden and my mom has to take care of me. My entire life has been ruined because of Big Pharma and the psychiatric system which wants to kill us. By the time I realized it was too late. There’s no help for me now. Anyways I’m going to have to finally end it. I just need some extra courage and to get away from my family trying to watch me. I don’t have that many means and I’m scared it won’t work but I need to make sure it will work 100%. A lot of the time I’m so sick and disabled I can’t even carry it out. I hope someone will kill me or I die in my sleep because I can’t take the torture any longer and I don’t want to feel guilty for hurting my family. I’m also too disabled to do it most of the time I have a hard time even walking. Please let me die in my sleep tonight or I will have to do it myself soon.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Hi everyone. First of all, I want to say thanks to all people here who try to help whatever way is available for them. I was going through posts and comments for a while and the community here seems to be great, so I've decided to trust my situation to you all. Before I make the post title more clear, here is a little background to it:

I'm having thoughts of suicide for last 3-4 years and so far I can't get rid of them permanently. Sometimes there are bursts of life which keep me up for a week or two, but eventually it all gets back there. I was unhappy in any of my recent relationships, because I feel incapable of actually loving someone. I live in the EU as a 3rd world country citizen doing whatever legal jobs that get me visa, so I won't be sent back to my unbearable shithole. 

At some point I started feeling that I'm tired of it all and want to quit, but I don't want to do it in a way that it will be very painful or that I'll make lots of people around witness something horrible(jumping onto a railway or something). So I came across the suicide bag, which seems to be the perfect way, and designed one for myself with an oxygen mask to make it more efficient. What I've mentioned though, is that when I realized that I have a ""Plan B"" for my life, I started living it kind of more to the max. I visited a bunch of concerts, did some random trips, booked a flight to Iceland and started throwing money out for things I like, which I wouldn't normally do.

However, when I found out about the suicide bag, I read some studies about it and found one from a Swiss clinic which legally provides assisted suicide. They were experimenting with helium through a device very similar to what I've got and reported that people go unconscious within 1 minute, but then actual death time may vary quite a lot from 7 to 30-40 minutes, what results in different oxygen intake. I was trying to find info about how much oxygen I may need for this, but couldn't find any resource so far. 

So, this leads to a question I had in mind, or maybe even two: where can I find some estimates on how much helium I may need for this and how to properly secure a tube to the helium tank? I assume there might be some more precise instructions out there, but I couldn't find them. Knowing this would actually help me to enjoy my life even more, since I would always have my Plan B ready when shit will hit the fan.

For what feels like all of my life I’ve been in a constant battle with it. Between being hurt and torn down by people who I thought loved/cared for me, sticking up for myself by telling them to fuck off or removing them from my life. And picking up the pieces they smashed down and out of me.

&lt;p&gt;To going to me, being those people to myself. Me, telling myself I’m not good enough, I’m fat, I’m ugly, I’m unloveable, I’m a waste of life etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now at almost 30, I’ve slowly started trying to be nicer to myself. Spending time outside. Actually going to therapy, taking meds, trying to talk nicely to myself. Accepting that I am actually not all of these things I’ve told myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my brain is so switchy. And most nights I find myself lying in bed, unable to sleep, hating myself. Wishing I could die. I just don’t understand why i am still alive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think anyone really wants me around. I try and make people happy, but I always end up feeling worse about myself and just wishing I wasn’t such a fuck up and try hard. No one loves me or cares. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don’t want to try anymore. It’s easier and makes so much more sense to just give into the bad brain talk and die.&lt;/p&gt;

My boyfriend has been suffering all his life, seeing violence from his parents for the past 20 years towards each other. My boyfriend has been used and betrayed by prior partners and friends so he trusts and relies on no one. Hes distant from his older siblings because they ignored the problems in the household and left elsewhere leaving him with 2 violent parents. He suffers from ptsd, and is constantly annoyed and angry. He hates his family and hates his recently deceased father for all the abuse and drinking his father chose. My boyfriend hates life, does not enjoy it, everyday he suffers gets headaches and gets angry. Everthing irritates him, drivers, ppl, wasps, shopping, summer, cooking, even games. He remembers his past clearly and is in constant pain from grieving his brother. His brother died because his patents are inept at emetional understanding. His brother sought love from women, love he didnt experience at home; same goes for my boyfriend. His brother was the only one who understood what my boyfriend feels. My boyfriend has no motivation, and little things irritates him ruining his whole day. He distracts himself with games and excercise, but is in constant anger.

Ive been talking and dating him online for 5 years prior to me living with him. I thought what he needed was a decent partner who would care, comfort, and love him. But that doesnt cure what he feels. His emotions get out of hand becoming irritated, angry, violent and suicidal. I try my best to spend time with him, talk to him, listen, but half the time even me being around irritates him. Its hard seeing him suffer night n day, and it stresses me sometimes into inner tears. 

For me all ive ever been good at is self reflection and studying. I grew up poor but with a good mom. I was doing well at college in engineering prior to my head injury. My emotions and depression solved thmselves with self love and i healed. But he is different, no amount of care or comforting can make him feel better. I cook, clean, massage, coddle, support, and listen to him everyday. But that isnt what he needs. I dont know how to help him. He is also reluctant to apply for health insurance for therapy. I love him, and i want to be useful, i was hoping someone knows what hatred is like. What grief is like, what depression is like. Because i dont understand it. And i was hoping someone would reccomend me literature than can give true therapy for the irritation/ anger he feels. 

It would be upsetting if my post was removed, but thankyou for anyone who comments with book suggestions or has decent advice. At anypoint mine and his live could end tragically, I just want him to be okay even if he doesnt want me anymore.

,SuicideWatch," I am 25F, not american. I am using a throwaway because this is embarrassing to talk about. 

I think that, in general, I have a good life and I just feel so ungrateful for always thinking about dying. I think everything started while I was in university because I just HATE the career path I chose. I had to finish my major because I was too scared to change and now I just feel stuck.

I struggled for two years to get a proper job. No matter how hard I tried, I always bombed the interviews. Having 200+ negative interviews really made me feel worthless and I just can’t forgive myself for being so incredibly inept. I feel like I have nothing to contribute to this world because everything I do seems to go wrong.

However, my family always supported me (They actually care about me). Even though I didn’t have my own money, I never struggled financially thanks to them. My brother actually realized that I was in a really dark place and he offered to pay for my therapy sessions. Therapy helps.

Also, just to clarify, my family is not rich, we live a normal life. I don’t live surrounded by luxury, but I never lacked a bed or food. I guess my life is good and average. 

After all this time I just got a job and now I am supposed to be happy? I thought that getting a job would actually make my life better, but I feel the same. I also hate the job, I work too many hours and I can’t even afford my rent with the pay. So, at 25yo my family STILL pays for my rent. I know that I am supposed to be grateful to have such an amazing family that supports me, but I just feel like a burden at this point. I see so many 18yo with no studies or preparation becoming millionaires on the internet that I can’t help but feel like a waste of air.

I feel stupid and whortless and I feel like somehow I am going to get fired and I’ll just go back to doing… nothing? To be clear, I am not a lazy person, I hate not having anything to do, but I feel that I am incapable of doing things right, so I am incredibly scared of new challenges. So, in the end, I just don’t want to do anything. That’s when I start thinking about dying.

I know I don’t have the courage to kill myself, but I just want to die. I don’t want to try to be better, I want to stop. I talked to my therapist about this and he says that he is not worried about me because he knows I won’t commit suicide and... I kinda agree. But I just can’t stop thinking about it.

Everywhere I go I think of possible ways of killing myself. ALL THE TIME. Even if I am in a good mood, I just can’t seem to stop thinking about it. I am not going to say any details because I know that there are vulnerable people here looking for ideas, but I do have a lot of ideas. I also think about how easy it would be if I just were in a freak accident where I could die and my family wouldn’t suffer as much. I hate typing this, but I have even wished I had cancer and just die. I feel horrible for this.

I feel like I have nothing to live for. I am not a successful person. I hate my career path. I don’t want to get married nor have kids. I loathe the idea of being in a relationship. I don’t look forward to the future. I don’t even look forward to death because I have no faith, I don’t believe in any god nor religion. I think this is just it. The only reason I wake up every morning at this point is because of my mom. I love my mom and I just couldn’t cause her the pain of losing a child. At this point I think that the day that my mom dies, I will actually get the courage to kill myself.

The only really “bad” thing that has happened to me was that my dad was an alcoholic. He definitely damaged me as a kid, but whenever I think about dying, I never think of him.

I don’t really know if I am suicidal, because I don’t think I will actually try to kill myself right now, but I just wish I could stop thinking about it. It really makes me feel horrible and ungrateful. I know that (if they reach this point) a lot of people are just going to say that I have to “grow up” because I have a “good” life and a family that loves me. I agree, but I can’t do it. I just want everything to stop.

I know this was a long read, so if you are still here, thank you. I am writing this because I hope that sharing my experience with someone will help me to not feel so lonely.

The absolute shame I'm being made to feel for surviving an attempt a few years ago is unreal. Nobody cares about the person behind the facts, just about the impact it has on them.

Employer (had to reveal medical info for security clearance): How do we know you won't do this again?

Friend (no longer friends but this was at the time): You are destroying my life.

Volunteering stuff (they don't need full medical info but had to reveal ""mental health issues""): it's inappropriate for you to want to do this.

I asked him why he’s treating me that way and responding in such an angry way and he started screaming and threatening to hang up the phone. 

I started crying and begging him to stop and so he did hang up the phone which basically floored me for the whole day unable to enjoy anything. This is on top of everything I own getting stolen.

This is not an exaggeration. There's nothing that I find remotely redeemable about myself and quite frankly I'm tired of it all. I want to kill myself, plain and simple.

I've talked to my mom about it and she keeps sarcastically encouraging me to do it. But the thing is, I might just take her word for it because I cannot do any of this anymore. 

I'm absolutely hideous, obese, nearly balding with multitudes of health issues, all at fucking eighteen years of age and I'm so ashamed of being trapped within my body. I hate myself so much, I can feel the revulsion deeply embedded within myself show up every glance I take at the mirror.

I'm so fucking ugly, I don't deserve to live.

Why am I this way?

I'm academically very stupid and my skills at everything are very lacking. Even for the major that I plan on taking, I don't have any fucking skills. My dream college rejected me and my friends all hate me (maybe only a little lesser than I do myself). 

My dad is emotionally abusive and mom is toxic as well as blackmails me every chance she gets. Everyone around me loves to pick on my appearance and weight and I despise my existence with every fibre of my being and have numerous cuts all over my body to attest to that.

The only reason I haven't done it yet is because I was afraid of accidentally surviving it, but I've come to realise that anything and everything is better than my existence. I'm not afraid anymore, I think.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm about to enter my senior year of college.

I'm terrified of what comes next.

I'm graduating with a music degree, but I want to become a 911 dispatcher. Genuinely, I want this job and I would feel fulfilled doing it. This isn't a goal I'm going for because I ""have to"". But there's so much more to surviving as an adult than just getting a job, y'know?

I'm going to have a lot of debt because I go to an expensive private college. When I picture the future all I can see is me, all alone, somewhere I don't know, not making any friends, being far away from everyone I love. I can't stay in my hometown (there's nothing for me here and it'd suck to live with my parents past college, though I do love them). I'm terrified I'm going to just be entirely and utterly alone.

And I don't know how I'm going to figure out the other adult stuff.

And I don't know if I am going to manage to survive.

The average salary for a 911 dispatcher lines up perfectly with what my mom said I'd probably need to make between rent, a car, expenses, and paying off loans, so I should feel better, right?

I don't have a car and that terrifies me. My parents can't afford to buy me one. I've had a disproportionate amount of friends whose parents/grandparents bought them/handed down a car. I'm scared I won't be able to afford one. I haven't been able to find a good school year job, just summer stuff. I'm hoping this year I can get something. But I don't think it's likely.

I was also just looking at a syllabus for one of my classes. I do well enough at school but it's always been a struggle to keep up because I coasted for years. I have a sinking feeling that it'll all just be the same this year.

I can't help but think my only viable option is to not live anymore.

I'm not fully human. I'm concious but I'm kind of an automaton. I have noticed the more time I spend away from people the worse I get. When I spend a few hours socially interacting I become my optimal snappy normal autonomous self, even though I'm really and introvert. 

But i have been partially isolated for months now and I'm in a trance like state. Its all haze and confusing. I take so long to answer questions. I cant al most focus on more than one tought. my grammar as you can see its terrible and going back to fix mistakes is sooo tiring. so mentally taxing.

,SuicideWatch,"   I don't even know where to start this. My mom's an alcoholic abusive fuck who constantly blames me for ruining her life and how she should've went through with the abortion when she's hammered, and when she's sober she constantly calls me an embarrassment and how she wants me gone. No matter how calmly I speak how nice I am she just rips me apart everytime I don't wanna do anything but lock myself in my room 24/7


  I'm trapped in some traumatic bond of a relationship, I'm constantly fucking manipulated and gaslighted, I'm ready to take my life so I turn to them for help and they just laughed in my face basically. That's what love is right. The person I love with all my heart doesn't give a fuck if I die. They're just keeping me around until they find a replacement, that's happened before so I know. I can't leave tho, I wanna be with them. I don't wanna be constantly hurting but I can't imagine life without them. I live in some false reality where I pretend their personality is what I want and not the abusive shit it is. We're currently long distance so it's really easy to just slip away in this daydream we're the perfect couple.


  I have no friends. No acquaintances or anything. Everyone I talked to in highschool stopped talking to me, i have social anxiety so trying to put myself out this is a no. I'm so fucking lonely I don't leave my house, I never got to make those ""teenage"" memories with a best friend. I spent majority of my teenage years in my house alone. Even if I had social skills I'm such a fuck up I'm terrified when they see the real me they'll leave. 


  My mental health is gone. I'm so fucking unstable to the point I've been blacking out n throwing massive rage fits. I even got charged for vandalism since it happened in public once. I'm terrified, that isn't who I am I don't know who controls me when these happen I don't know what even triggers them to happen but afterwards I feel so guilty and judged I wanna fucking off myself I can't take it. 



  I've been screaming and begging for help, that I can't take it anymore but nobody listens. I don't know how to get help. I don't know who to ask where to go or anything. I will not do impatient treatment or go into a psych ward, mainly because I have two indoor cats and my mom always being drunk she leaves the door open sometimes. If I lose my cats that's the end of me, they're my only lifeline. 

  I've debated texting a suicide hotline number but I'm so scared they'll break confidentiality because I definitely am at high risk of hurting myself and/or taking my own life right now. The last thing I need is police banging on the door to throw me into a padded cell in the hospital. 

  No matter how optimistic I've been how hard I've been trying to pull myself out of this hole it blows up in my face. I spent 2yrs trying to turn it all around, and now it's at the worst it's ever been. I don't know what the future holds whenever I think it can't get worse it does and I can't take it anymore.


  Like I said my cats are my only reason I'm alive right now.  But today I've been having these fuck it all type thoughts where they don't matter. Nothing does. Once I'm gone all my memories are wiped away so I won't feel guilty I won't watch them from above n feel bad, I'll be gone. I'll not be suffering anymore, but that makes me feel so guilty it's overwhelming

I'm jist overwhelmed in general I'm sick to being curled up in my bed crying so hard I can't breathe, I'm sick of crying so much it makes me throw up. I haven't eaten anything in 4 days I'm just so fucking done I don't wanna feel like this anymore

I don't know where to go who to turn to July 27th marked a year since my last attempt and honestly I wish I wasn't so pathetic and failed. If I could do something right for once I wouldn't be here suffering. But I made the idiotic choice of ""oh it'll get better"" when it's gotten worse the last year.

5 years ago, I was diagnosed with OCD and depression. I've never recovered. I wish I could be happy and passionate about things as I used to be  

In those 5 years, I've finished off my undergraduate degree, ran long-distance races and done countless internships. On the contrary, my ex left me because I were mentally unstable and I've struggled to find a full-time job. 

If only I weren't slow at doing things during my internships (even though my performances were great). If only I wasn't slow whilst doing the dishes. If only my mental health issues weren't an obstacle. My ex would still be with me today and I would have had a fantastic gpa/grades. If only I wouldn't struggle whilst doing practice papers for the GRE or whilst writing my CV. If only I could brush my teeth twice a day and take a shower daily. If only I could lose weight and go on a diet. If only I were good at playing the piano or cooking and not below average. If only I could achieve my goals (let it be small or big). If only I were mentally well and happy. If only I could stop being arrogant after doing things. 

If only I had the courage to commit suicide because I want to end this miserable feeling. If only I could not wake up one morning. If only my prayers of a death wish were answered. 

A friend of mine from primary school passed away in a car crash last week. If only it were me and not him. If only I could be sent to prison for life for a crime I did not commit. If only I could stab myself in the head with the knife that is currently in my room. I want to end this shitty and miserable feeling. 

I am considering self-harming myself tonight. I am considering punching myself and using my knife. I can't take this anymore. If only I could explain to people the situation I am in. If only I could describe what I am feeling. I cried nunerous times before writing this post. I don't know if I've included everything.

,SuicideWatch,"I wrote a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/ot7dhc/after_16_years_of_being_the_funny_kid_i_found/) previously about my suicidal mindset, my beliefs.

TLDR: my mom is extremely emotionally abusive, and manipulative.

I was born in Virginia US, and I lived there for 10 years. When I was 10 years old, my father died, cutting off our only source of income. My mom was capable of working, but she chose not to, because her father asked her to live in India where she would not have to work (my grandfather is stinking rich. He owns a half billion dollar company), and so my mom decided that instead of being independant with slightly smaller income, she would rather be dependant on my grandfather, and not work ever.

Something clearly short-circuited in her brain, the second we stepped foot on indian soil, she turned into a sadistic, gaslighting psychopath who would actively look for opportunities for blaming me for everything that goes wrong in her life.

I ignored this behavior for three fucking years, because I had figured that she was grieving for my father (we moved to india about a month after the death, and she was still processing). I figured that she would self-normalize, and everything would be back to normal in a few months

I could not have been more wrong. as the time passed, she got worse and worse.

Three fucking years of my life, I spent kissing her ass, and trying not to be a ""disappointment"".

Then one day, when she was hitting me with a wooden spatula, I decided that enough was enough. I am done taking this shit from her. Please note that At the time I was 5'11, and my mom was barely 5'4 and I was still taking beatings from her and not doing anything.

I raised fucking hell that day. She had hit me for the third or fourth time over something stupid, like spilled water, and I simply grabbed the spoon from her hand and snapped it in half, as though it were butter. I yelled until my fucking lungs felt like a meth-smoker who had overdosed 40 times in 3 seconds. I yelled at her about how she was taking out her issues on me, and how spilled water is nothing to hit people for. 

During this time, I still didnt mention the entire three years of abuse that I had endured. 

I didnt want to address something that I could not change. But i should have done it when I had the opportunity. 

Anyways. She took this reaction as an opportunity to say that I had ""behavioral issues"".

She promptly put me in therapy, thinking that it would change me to be her ideal fucking slave, who does everything he is told without questioning.

She put me in with a doctor that she knew, because she thought that she could manipulate her into telling me that I was the problem. 

this doctor was very professional however, and told my mom to leave the room. I didnt trust her at first, but then she told me that I was allowed to call the police if she ever told anyone what I told her in the session.

Lo and behold. the floodgates opened. 

SHe did a bunch of tests

lo and behold, within a month I had been diagnosed with extreme clinical depression, ADHD, Dyslexia, and a few other mental illnesses.

Once the diagnosis had been completed, She prescribed me some antidepressents, which my mother promptly refused to buy.

However, because the therapist took the money out of her fee, and bought me the meds. I was almost in tears. Here was someone who didint even truly know me, and she felt comfortable enough to take my meds out of her personal income. 

They didnt really help, and so she just started working on my mental health

The initial outburt that I had had (snapping the wooden spoon), released the floodgates and I started to really have behavioral issues.

I am currently 6'4, and I use that height to my advantage. I get in fights all the time, sometimes hoping the other person would win, because I just want physical pain to match the pain inside. I started self-harm, and cutting, and all sorts of other shit. I was a weed addict, alcoholic, and chainsmoker (by the age of 14), and I was just flat out ready to die. 

A bunch of great commentors on the above linked post, made me realize that I only need to survive for two more years in this house. I can kiss their ass until I finish college (I want to become a psychologist to help other people like me get through what they are going through), and when I finnaly get a job, Im going to cut contact",t2_7n4pxooc,False,,0,False,So we are back to this again,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,,False,t3_ou58iw,False,dark,1.0,,public,6,0,{},2a7b5518-8e45-11e5-a506-0ed10b342609,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,6,,False,False,,False,modmsg,[],{},,True,,1627589358.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote a &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/ot7dhc/after_16_years_of_being_the_funny_kid_i_found/""&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; previously about my suicidal mindset, my beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I am 22 years old and have taken somewhere in the ballpark of 20 medications. I've had enough blood draws to become a pincushion. I've had 10+ years of therapy, because I am a victim of long term abuse, malpractice, and have been sexually assaulted many times- even at the hands of a doctor.

&amp;#x200B;

None of this has helped me in any way. I need care and understanding, and there is none to be had. I have no family, most of them are dead. The person who abused me the most in my family is terminally ill and on her deathbed. I am incredibly alone, despararely in need of human connection and support due to my conditions, and absolutely no one cares.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I became ill with CFS, chronic pain, and IBS, I already suffered greatly from the abuse, as well as the autism I was born with. My difficulties with autism including significant speech issues and dyspraxia were dismissed and I did not receive an official diagnosis on my medical records until it was too late. Throughout my childhood I was mocked and treated like a failure by my teachers and peers, because I could not communicate properly.

&amp;#x200B;

Little did I know that hell would become worse when I ended up physically disabled. There truly is no compassion for the weak in this world. I do not qualify for benefits, and I cannot work full time. I hurt myself for many years trying to force myself to do things I was not able to, because no one believed me, and now I am permanently damaged. I can not walk long distances anymore and am in constant physical pain and exhaustion.

&amp;#x200B;

People act like it is my mindset that is the issue and not the way the world treats disabled people. I try to stay in education and get held to the same standards as an able bodied person. My partner resents me and acts like it is an extreme pain to put up with me because I am always ""complaining."" I rely on my partner for stability and shelter, and he threatens to yank that from me at any time.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet, I am still blamed for not loving my life. A life where I cannot do most of the things healthy young people can. A life where my vision is permanently disoriented, where I am always ill, dizzy, unable to eat what I want without pain, unable to move around too much, always malaised and ready to sleep again. 

&amp;#x200B;

A life where people don't truly believe I am ill because the disease is invisible. A life where I am gaslit about the severity of my pain constantly because I cannot function normally, nor can I jump through the hoops to beg the beurocrats for poverty level disability benefits because I have already been told I don't qualify under current rules.

&amp;#x200B;

No one understands and thinks I'm totally insane for wanting to die. I'm sure if they were subjected to a life where they could barely do what they enjoy, where no one believed their pain, where they were subjected to abuse and poverty simply for becoming ill through no fault of their own, they would not blame people like me for being suicidal.

&amp;#x200B;

Quality of life is far more important to me tha quantity. I hate how I am forced to suffer, being treated worse and worse everyday by the entire world. Yet I am not allowed to end my misery? 

&amp;#x200B;

No, I am not insane for acknowledging reality. It is not my mindset thats the issue. Therapy will not fix the dehabilitating physical pain that is DESTROYING me. Stop treating sick people like we choose to be in agony.

,SuicideWatch,"My mother has been threatening suicide on me for the past weeks. Telling me in detail how she wanted to do it, and that she would have left a letter accusing me of pushing her to the edge. She furthermore refuses to seek professional help, because I am the only cause of our depression. 

For years I've functioned on what I call ""survival mode"" : work on the most important stuff, brush details or small tasks aside.

Well this nonchalant behavior of not allocating energy to details and small tasks finally bit me in the ass this week.

- I didn't put enough effort into formatting excel files, which let down my colleague and forced him to take the workload. He resented me immensely for this. I also know he complained about me to other colleagues. 

- I put away participating in a colleague's goodbye gift and eventually forgot. All my colleagues knew about it and treated me like a pariah.

My work was the last thing I had left. If my colleagues hate me, going into work will become extremely painful. I saw no more issues to my suffering. Not to mention, I have trouble understanding social cues and creating bonds. I worry I'm not fit to live in a society, or work with colleagues.


I had an unused prescription for antidepressants, and I planned to go to my pharmacy and swallow them all.

However I put it off. I called the suicide line twice. While the discussions felt a bit superficial, they managed to convey important things : 1. Forgetting to participate in a gift will be forgiven in time as my actions speak for themselves (I am actually a very empathetic person) 2. One bad work performance on something as minor as formatting excel files will eventually get buried under the rest of my good deeds, as long as I show I learned from my mistakes and don't do the same shit.

I have a shit load of structural issues that keep putting me down. My relationship with my mother, me thinking not allocating time and energy to small tasks is efficiency, my crippling depression, me getting a debilitating anxiety attack everytime something goes bad at work, me not being able to socialize and create bonds.

I realized all of this has no relationship to work. If I keep using work as a band-aid, I'll keep getting hurt again and again. I need to tackle my structural issues.

So in the end, I didn't go to the pharmacy, even though I already had taken the prescription out of my binder. I decided that my issues were in fact solvable, and I wanted to at least give it a serious try ; not for my colleagues (these I will leave soon enough) but for myself.

This goes beyond work and colleagues, which are temporary. I want to understand why I'm living the way I do. I want to give myself some compassion, while not running away from my misshaps. I want to change, I know I can if I understand why I'm doing it, and if a professional can give me tools and advice to cope better and change behavior.

Fuck my colleagues. This goes well beyond them. They are not in my head, they can't know what I am going through, and it's ok. I want to do it for me, not for work.

Now that I have a precise goal and an actual plan to tackle my issues, a door has been reopened. I will live for me.",t2_967hfqh2,False,,0,False,Woke up with a plan to commit suicide - decided to give myself the chance to face my problems,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,,False,t3_ou6zvn,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,False,,1627595891.0,,[],{},,True,,1627594788.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mother has been threatening suicide on me for the past weeks. Telling me in detail how she wanted to do it, and that she would have left a letter accusing me of pushing her to the edge. She furthermore refuses to seek professional help, because I am the only cause of our depression. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years I&amp;#39;ve functioned on what I call &amp;quot;survival mode&amp;quot; : work on the most important stuff, brush details or small tasks aside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well this nonchalant behavior of not allocating energy to details and small tasks finally bit me in the ass this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t put enough effort into formatting excel files, which let down my colleague and forced him to take the workload. He resented me immensely for this. I also know he complained about me to other colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I put away participating in a colleague&amp;#39;s goodbye gift and eventually forgot. All my colleagues knew about it and treated me like a pariah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work was the last thing I had left. If my colleagues hate me, going into work will become extremely painful. I saw no more issues to my suffering. Not to mention, I have trouble understanding social cues and creating bonds. I worry I&amp;#39;m not fit to live in a society, or work with colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an unused prescription for antidepressants, and I planned to go to my pharmacy and swallow them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I put it off. I called the suicide line twice. While the discussions felt a bit superficial, they managed to convey important things : 1. Forgetting to participate in a gift will be forgiven in time as my actions speak for themselves (I am actually a very empathetic person) 2. One bad work performance on something as minor as formatting excel files will eventually get buried under the rest of my good deeds, as long as I show I learned from my mistakes and don&amp;#39;t do the same shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a shit load of structural issues that keep putting me down.

,SuicideWatch,"Things have felt especially shitty for me recently.

I have had eczema for 4-5 years now, but it used to just be limited to the backs of my thighs. That sucked and I got self conscious about wearing shorts. Then it started going down my legs and I couldn't shave or wax anymore. I stopped wearing shorts altogether and I recently stared getting my eczema under control. 

After that it spread to my genitals and it's disgusting (shaving or waxing irritates it and makes things worse), painful, and humiliating. There's nothing I can really do to get it completely under control, and nothing's working. That was a month ago. Now it's on my arms and most recently, my eyelids. It hurts to know that it might go on for the rest of my life and people will always think I'm gross now because I got the bad share from the gene pool. It hurts to cry and it hurts having to bottle things up in fear of causing flare ups. 

I've always been very self conscious. I'm around 5 feet tall and I weigh 116 pounds. Everyone tells me I'm fine but based off of what I've been told, I know I need to lose weight. I've lost 10 pounds so far this summer (I'm trying to keep under the radar so my parents don't find out) and my main goal for the end of the year is to get to 100 pounds and then 90. I want so badly to be tiny but my parents are all for body positivity and discourage me from trying. 

I constantly feel unwanted and unloved and it's draining. My family doesn't give me much affection or attention and I'm always lonely. I just want to feel loved and cared for and what I want the most in life is to find someone I can spend it  with. Guys never look at me. I'm unattractive. I know it for a fact. They used to dare each other to ask me out as a 'joke' and they would always say ""Please say no"" before asking. It hurts so badly. I want to start wearing makeup but I'm allergic to so many skin products that I can't use anything that's not going to be expensive. 

I've been suicidal before and have been sent to a behavioral health center a couple years back but that's because I told my family about it. Instead of listening to me, they just dumped me somewhere else so they didn't have to deal with me. I'm a burden and this time I'm not sure if I should tell them anything. My mother will just try to force religion onto me (isn't believing in God enough? Why should I pray to something we can't prove the existence of?) And my father won't react. The last time I had a major break down he laughed at me and watched. I do have a therapist, but that's not helping me because if she finds out she'll tell my family. 

I can't keep this up. I'm so tired and I haven't had much of an appetite. I'm crying again and my eyes are burning. I want to end it all but my mother says I'm selfish because of it. My father says I'm choosing to feel this way. I'm scared and I just want to disappear. What's the point of sticking around? I don't have a future ahead of me... no plans except finishing high school and moving out. My parents don't even want me to move out; they keep saying I owe them for all the years they took care of me. 

I want so badly to have someone hold me and tell me it's okay. Nobody loves me enough to do that and I just wish I could die. Why does this keep happening? I want to be happy.

I have struggled my entire life with mental issues. Shit really got real when I got into high school the amount of shit I had to go through was crazy and has 100% destroyed me as a person.
