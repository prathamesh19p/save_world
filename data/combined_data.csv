"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",SQLwitch,133,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/

"I hate it so much when you try and express your feelings to your parents, but they turn it around and compare your suffering with theirs.","I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much.

So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. 

At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. 

And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care. 

Thanks for reading, I hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness. Along with having a parent who doesn't make your suffering all about them and why you shouldn't be depressed.",TheNewKiller69,8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fedwbi/i_hate_it_so_much_when_you_try_and_express_your/
"I went to the hospital because I was having really bad panic attacks, and theycontinued in there.

This world has no place for people like me.,"A bit of context. I'm an American. I'm black. I'm big. I'm ugly. And I'm autistic. I work as an aircraft mechanic.

The more I go through every day, the less I see the point of continuing with this life. No one who's gotten to know me as a person wants anything to do with me. People make fun of my quirks all the time - they think they're being funny, but they're being obnoxious. Besides that, the only friends I still have are the ones in high school, who are now so far away. My father, the man who cared about me more than anyone else did, passed away a few years ago from sudden heart and kidney failure, while I was waiting on a connecting flight to visit him.

Besides that, people will only connect with me as much as they need to. I clearly have problems that I do not know how to address. No amount of therapy has fixed those issues.

People cross the street when they see me on the sidewalk. Society here in general doesn't like people like me, with so many people supporting an openly racist president as we regress. I know that I won't ever be able to rely on the cops for anything, because I'm likely to get shot before they figure out what the issue is. I've been racially profiled many times when I lived in New York City. I happened to be stopped for every ""random"" drug search whenever I took the Staten Island ferry while carrying a backpack.

That being the case, the only value of any sort I can provide to society is in the job I do. I'm also doing vocational training for a higher qualification, but every day I'm questioning more and more why I care. More money isn't going to fix me as a person.

The truth is, I'm a mistake. I learned a few years ago that I was adopted at birth. Probably before my new parents knew I would be as difficult as I was. I should've been aborted or left to die.

The prognosis for our world grows more dire every day due to global warming facilitated by old people who don't give a shit about us. There is no reason to believe things will get better - people reject science more and more, and we are going backwards.

Before long, I will have a gun. It will allow me to protect myself where I know law enforcement won't. But it'll also give me the power to choose when I want to die. That, at the very least, will give me peace of mind - knowing I have a way out whenever I need it.

I'm not some ""starving kid in Africa"" or whatever other bullshit people push to those who are discontented, but I have still been dealt a pretty shitty hand in life. I see no reason to keep bothering with it when so many things are wrong with me, and our future will only get worse.",InsertANameHeree,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fegd6t/this_world_has_no_place_for_people_like_me/
I’m not even worthy of being counted during attendance.,"I go to a small school, normally no more than 20 students are in a classroom, yet my teachers don’t even realize I’m in their class most of the time. I have amazing teachers, and they always want to help students learn, but I’m always forgotten about. I’m not slow enough to need special help, I’m not smart enough to need no help though. I’m pretty quiet, and I almost always get interrupted by loud people. If I actually work up the nerve to ask a question in my asshole-filled classes, the teacher gets distracted by two idiots trying to kill each other and forgets about me. 

I know I probably sound like a spoiled child that just wants attention, but I don’t. All I want is to not be forgotten, to not be interrupted, to not be counted absent in a class when I’m always there.",chroms-leather-belt,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fef10i/im_not_even_worthy_of_being_counted_during/
"8 years ago, I posted here, wanting to die. My life is so much better now.","When I was 15-16 years old, I posted here in my darkest moments. I couldn't see any reason to keep living. I thought I was nothing special and the next 8 years seemed like an endless slog. You can look through my post history if you want. 

Since then, I graduated college and graduate school. I have traveled the world. I swam with bioluminescent algae in Indonesia. I've hiked among alpacas in Peru. I learned to speak Spanish fluently and connected with people around the world and in my own country, who speak Spanish too. I've published my writing i  multiple publications. I have fallen in love and had my heart broken several times. I realized I'm gay, came out, and I'm with the most amazing woman. I have a career that I love where I help people every day. I can honestly say that depression may be a lifelong struggle for me, but it is possible to recover and develop tools to cope with it. Every day is a manageable challenge now. Every day I am grateful to just be alive. I am SO GLAD that I didn't kill myself 8 years ago. I never would have known how beautiful my life could become.

Before you think about killing yourself, remember that you don't know how beautiful your life could become. How could you? You have no way of knowing until you get there.

Can I leave some baggage here,"Im not sure if this is the place to post this but here we go. Apologies in advance this is going to be all over the place, im on mobile and im lost. Not real names, this is a throw away etc etc etc.
Okay so im 22 M I guess I've been dealing with depression for about 8 years. I have anxiety , I'm self conscious and I like to believe im more fucked up than I actually am and if it's okay here I'd like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where I am now to no one in particular.
I was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You'd have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That's the first few years of life. I ran around as a ""happy"" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone's emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I'm struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let's continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to ""protect"" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted ""who I was"" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn't touch anyone with out them screaming ""DONT TOUCH ME GERM"" ""GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF"" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn't even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn't back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn't bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I'm greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) ""You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak"". I can't tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me ""mysteriouslyreddited"". I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn's amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn't seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don't remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I've ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn't stand up for myself or tell myself it's okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that's how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven't reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that's false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn't been on one in years and I'd like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I'd pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell ""get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!"". I replied with ""well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you're ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are"" and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother's husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I'd had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I'd seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and ""ignored"" her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you'd find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don't remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I've had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I'm worried that I won't be able to win. I don't recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I've become. I love my GF but I feel like I'm going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I'm not good enough for her and I'm hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I've talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I'm not looking for a way to leave her. I've been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there's no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well). I'm not looking for help I just need to talk to someone. I am doing okay I just had so much pent up I needed a release. Next therapy session will hopefully straighten up my current state of mind",mysteriouslyreddited,7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fecmob/can_i_leave_some_baggage_here/

Just an advice :),"Watch After Life on Netflix.

Letter from my girlfriend,"&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend wrote me this letter and agreed to share it here... 

&amp;#x200B;

Letter to my depressed lover.

I see you. I know you’re in there. The man who loved and sought joy, the man who felt

deserving of happiness. He is blindfolded, held hostage, cold and chained in a windowless

basement, by a tyrant who thrives off suffering. At times it feels like there is no hope, at

times it feels like there is no escape. You are weakened, the exhaustion has taken over your

body, your mind and your soul, you question whether you’ll ever be strong enough to fight

this mighty tyrant, to escape from his grip, out of the darkness. Will you ever be able to feel

the sun stroking your skin again? Will you ever see the light again? Will you ever feel love

again?

Why are you here? How did you get here? You never asked for this, no one would.

A tyrant is an illegitimate ruler who controls through oppression. Tyranny is not fair, it is not

understanding, and it is cruel. The tyrant wants to weaken you until you have no choice but

to succumb, he will brainwash you until you come to terms with his reign, until you are no

longer a threat to him. The tyrant wants you to think that he is too strong to ever beat, too

mighty to outthink, too present to escape.

But let me tell you something about Tyrants. Anger, hate, always stems from fear, and pain.

Behind every tyrant is a hurt child. Behind every tyrant is a voice that was once unheard, a

heart that was once broken, eyes that were once blinded. The tyrant doesn’t want you to

see the light, because the light was once taken from him, he doesn’t want you to know love,

because love was once taken from him, and he wants you to hurt, because he hurts.

But how can tyranny be defeated? When tyranny is defeated by force, it often just paves

the way for another form of tyranny. You don’t want to kill your tyrant, you’ll be left with

blood on your hands and trauma in your soul, if you kill you’ll have to hide, and what is the

point of fighting your way out of the darkness, just to make your way into another form of

darkness?

No. Your tyrant won’t be defeated by force. He will be defeated by love, and I know that

your love is strong enough to turn him around.

The man that I love finds joy in the little things, the touch of the grass against his feet, the

sight of birds in the trees, the sound of a stick falling on icy water. The man that I love is

surprising, he is unapologetically original, passionate, and doted of a natural humour. The

man that I love is caring and has an emotional intelligence that can make anyone around

him feel seen, heard, and loved. The man that I love is wise, he can offer advice that you

never knew you needed, and he can be the ray of sunshine in anyone’s day. The man that I

love will lighten up entire rooms and soothe even your deepest worries with care and

attention. The man that I love, can love so strongly, so unconditionally, so powerfully, that

he can make anyone’s darkness fade away. So, if anyone is going to bring this tyrant down,

it will be the man that I love.

Love can make your tyrant feel seen, it can make him feel comfortable enough to talk,

comfortable enough to tell you about what pain led him to tyranny. When faced with love,

with a powerful, unconditional love, and an acceptance that is free of all judgment, your

&amp;#x200B;

tyrant will be able to start facing up to his actions, he will be able to start realising that all

along he was causing you to suffer for reasons that had nothing to do with you, they were

never your fault, he was only causing you to suffer, because he was suffering. When that

realisation will spring upon him, he will remove your blindfold and you will see that you are

facing yourself. But don’t worry, it’s just a mask the tyrant originally wore to trouble you, he

won’t wish to do that anymore though, he’ll unchain you and remove his mask, and you will

realise that all along, your tyrant was only a child. Suddenly the anger you felt towards your

tyrant will vanish, because you are a man who is fair, just and loving, you are a man who

doesn’t believe in punishment nor revenge, you are a man who can forgive. You are a man

who can recognise when a child simply needs to be held, loved and nurtured.

So you will take the child’s hand. At first, he will be fearful, he has been hurt before, who’s

to say that you won’t hurt him? But you will give him your word, you will promise him that

he is safe with you, and deep in your heart, you will know that you are telling the truth. The

child will weep in your arms, and you will hold him tighter, you will tell him that he is loved,

he is heard, he is seen, and that from this moment forward, he will never be alone.

You will come out of the basement with the child, hand in hand. And although at first it will

feel like a relief, it won’t be easy. You haven’t seen the sun in so long, its light will feel

blinding and uncomfortable, your body will still feel weak, and as you’ll barely feel able to

look after yourself, you’ll start to wonder how you could possibly look after this child? But

you will surprise yourself. Through the small pleasures you once enjoyed, such as feeling the

cool grass underneath your feet, you will find strength. Enough strength to lift yourself up,

carry the child, and start walking. It will be challenging, and you’ll worry that each step

might be your last step, you’ll worry that you might fall and never find the strength to get

back up, but you’ll keep putting a foot in front of the other, until it starts to feel natural.

Eventually you’ll look up and realise that the sun isn’t as blinding as it was when you first

came out, you’ll see a path, and you’ll know how to get home.

On your way home, you will worry that bringing this child back might be too much of a

burden for me. What if I don’t want him? What if I don’t love him? After all he was once a

tyrant, how could I love him? And what if I don’t even love you anymore? You’ve been gone

for so long, what if I’ve stopped waiting? What if I’ve given up? What if I’ve found someone

else? What if I just end up hurting you and the child more than you’ve both already been

hurt?

But all this time, I’ve been waiting for you. I’ve been worrying, I’ve been crying, you

disappeared so suddenly I never understood what had happened. I made it my mission to

find you, I was up day and night trying to save you, I called on you a thousand times, I

searched for clues in every corner, I even tried to negotiate with your tyrant, but to no avail,

it only angered him more. I tried to get help, but no one could help me, and in the end, I was

left weakened. That’s when I realised that I was exhausting myself, and I wasn’t helping you.

So I did the only thing I could do. I stopped trying to save you and trusted that you would be

able to save yourself, and as I waited for you to do that, I held our space, I nourished our

space so that you could come back to a loving and nurturing home, one where you could

one day feel whole again and heal.

&amp;#x200B;

When you come home, I will welcome your little boy with open arms, and love him, just as I

learned to love the little girl who once held me hostage in a basement. The truth is I already

know your little boy, I’ve seen him in your shadows, and I’ve already grown to love him. You

also know my little girl, she has been living in our home throughout our entire relationship.

She has loved you as much as I have, and although at first she was afraid of you, she was

afraid that you would hurt her, she grew to love you, and she learned to trust you. When

you were gone for so long, she began to worry, she worried that perhaps you would never

come back, she worried that perhaps you didn’t want to come back to us, perhaps you

wanted another home, a different home, perhaps you had stopped loving us.

But I reassured her, and I told her about the love that we shared, the hours and days we

spent looking into each other’s eyes, as time stood still and the world around us vanished,

and we questioned, every day, how we could be so lucky. Our love is the truest love I’ve

ever known, our love is the deepest love I’ve ever known, and I know that a love like ours,

never just goes away.

One day my little girl will meet your little boy, and they will love each other as much as we

love each other, the four of us will build a home so whole, that all our fears will be replaced

by trust, our anger will be replaced by love, and tyranny will be nothing but a distant

memory.

This isn’t going to happen overnight, we don’t want you to exhaust yourself trying to come

home, we don’t want you to run and fall, we want you to make wise and calculated steps, so

that you can slowly but surely come back to us.

If I could, I would be in the basement with you, but you don’t want me there, and if I force

myself into the basement, my little girl will turn into a tyrant again and our home will

collapse. So although I’m not in the darkness with you, know that I can still see you, and I

am still here, holding our fort, waiting for you to find the strength to love your tyrant

unconditionally, so that you can bring him home for us to nurture and heal him, so that he

can learn to fearlessly trust both of us.",psst_shhh,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fectqt/letter_from_my_girlfriend/

I got a job, my grades were good and was hanging out with friends regularly. However the past two weeks things have went to absolute shit. My parents decided they wanted to try some ""parenting"" and decided I spent ""too much time on video games"". Even though I really only played 1-2 hours a night. It was one of the main ways I interacted with my friends as well. After that they decided that my phone was distracting me so it was confiscated as soon as I got home from school. Then they decided to take my door off the hinges to look in on me more. The worst part is i don't even know why they are doing all of this. My grades were good, A's and B's and in 6 AP classes while working 20 hours a week and maintaining a social life. Everything was going so good. Now I get home and feel empty and alone. I can't even cry in privacy. then they have the audacity to ask ""Honey whats wrong, why are you sad?????"".

"I was told it gets better, 10 years later and it just got numb.","So first of all, I don't know if this is a rule or not, but I've never been to a doctor's and actually got confirmed to have depression, I have anxiety issues and likely agoraphobia, I haven't left the house for 4 years, even then it only lasted a month, since before that I hadn't left the house in 5 years. Even before that, I didn't receive a high school education as I spent it all, you guessed it, in my house.

There was a small portion in my life where I actually had friends, 10 years ago, I was active, ""fun"", enjoying my life fairly well but occasionally I was still in the dumps. Most of my friends seemed to be the same way so we talked about it a lot. Of course my friend at the time tried to encourage me, tell me it gets better and kept an eye on me to make sure I was coming out of my shell so to say.

So of course I fucked that up, I made a small mistake, said sorry, they forgave me and I punished myself by not allowing myself to see my friends. Still haven't seen them to this day, besides one, my so. Somehow, they have infinite patience and can put up with all my shit.

I punished myself a lot, I'd cut myself, I'd punch and slam myself, destroy my own possessions. My so tried their best and it sort of fizzled out. These days I don't get the will to do so anymore.

Ever since then, nothing, for a whole 10 years, most of it I didn't even spend time with my mother and younger sister. Maybe I was still punishing myself. I had few hobbies or even things to do, though I didn't fully enjoy any of it, I was starting to feel pretty emotionless.
Towards the end I actually started reconnecting with my mother and finally learning stuff and just starting to connect with my sister.

It was going fairly well for me, I was starting to look at the bright side, I still never left my house but it was starting to feel comfortable instead of a prison.

But then my sister did something unspeakable, something I don't think I could ever forgive, but my mother did, instantly. I was hurt, angry and it pulled me straight back. Ever since I've been weird around my sister, finding it almost impossible to connect and angry at my mother.

So now, I just feel numb, I really don't know what to do, I've been trying to forgive and forget but it's impossible. I've been trying to go outside but I almost have panic attacks just thinking about it sometimes. I'm back to the prison with nothing to do but wait.

Why do I still have a feeling like I’m doing everything wrong?,"These are just random things because I guess I need a hug. 


I’ve been feeling so lonely lately. I can’t do even basic stuff, like I need to motivate myself to take a shower or find reasons to eat something. I’m finally taking some medication. I still struggle with finding a job, but it’s okay I guess, kinda regret wasting all my money and not saving more. That’s like a coping mechanism. I starve myself and then feel sick again. I can’t motivate myself to workout because I don’t have any limits and I either don’t do anything or workout till I’m exhausted. I either cry a lot because of everything or feel nothing at all. I have like two friends now and my boyfriend. I appreciate them the most. But I really hate myself for not being able to have phone calls with my boyfriend(we’re in a long distance rn). I really love him and I want to change it but I can’t make myself do that?? Like he knows about my issues and he’s very patient and supportive but I have a feeling like I’m bothering him al the tome and making him feel sad because calling someone you love is like the very basic thing that can make you feel closer to each other. But that’s not the point of my post, I have no idea if it even makes sense. 



I’m so tired, I’m not feeling broken, I’m not having desire to end my life because I know that it’s just temporary and I’ll be fine. But I’m feeling extremely not motivated at all, I’m sad and I hate myself for not being productive. I’m afraid to lose my boyfriend or my friends and I hate being that annoying person who always asks “you don’t regret our relationship”. I’m tired and I have no idea what to do. I’ve been feeling so sad lately and very stressed and I can’t sleep and I have headaches all the time. I just want to cry and to get a hug maybe.

desolation,"depression is writing sick poetry on skin and publishing it with scars, cutting on ankles, not wrists because you’re scared you’ll get in trouble but you so desperately need to be seen, and never are.

depression is writing the word “alone” and seeing the word “home”, accepting the pain like a gift because you deserve it.

May take college medical withdrawal but I'll be broke? Long read,"I'm at a cross roads. Yesterday, I had a mid term and showed up 50 minutes late. I had actually gotten up that morning to go and take it (my mom took the car extra early and came back late even though I told her that I needed to be at school). Unfortunately this didnt help the fact that I havent been attending school or doing the hwks and labs. My programming professor understood and gave me the slip to go back to do the labs and hwks that I missed. Though again, yesterday I was told that I'm approaching the deadline for this consideration very close and was suggested to take a medical withdrawal by my professor. This year just isnt my year. I feel withdrawn from everything and just cant bring myself to hold onto the shread of stability. Me missing my classes is also something I told my therapist and psychiatrist about. 

My professor wants to hold a meeting with me and my academic advisor to see if there is a way to avoid medical withdrawal and catch up on assignments. I appreciated the consideration until early today, when I realized that I most likely wont be attending lab today either. I cant keep doing this. This is the second time I've taken this class and its gotten admittedly worse. The first time was alright but this time...is terrible. I dont have a support group like last time and I dont have a team. My first time, I was turning in assignments but the lack on my part was not studying for the midterm but I still had a long stride of actually passing then. I feel so uncomfortable in class, I feel like a foreigner.  I get sad because it's  as if I have no idea what's going on around me and it makes me so sad. 

I have a sibling who faced this problem when she tried attending college. She got depressed, started sleeping in and never leaving for school. I dont know why we cant stay in college and actually graduate but it seems like a curse. 


If I leave school, I'm faced with having to leave my school job. If I lose my school job, I wont have any funds. My mother will be leaving me in our hometown and I wont be able to get help from her like I need . I know that if i withdraw, i wont be able to withdraw from one class, I'd have to leave all of them. I didnt have the best if luck from finding work without school ties. So, I'm scared to leave school. I'm diagnosed with depression and GAD. I'd be anxiety ridden and depressed knowing that I'll be holding my grad year back and I wont be able to conjure up funds. 

I wanted to love school. I know I can love learning but I cant seem to love that or anything else right now. I was supposed to be graduating this year but I souldnt be anyway due to needing more classes to complete. I had planned on passing this semester and taking up extra summer classes go shorten time but ...that's all gone.

Feeling suicidal after reading a pedophilic romance manga,"Hi all,

I'm 22 years old and are working as software engineer.. On the last 3 days, I just got emotionally triggerred just by reading a manga that potrays loneliness and pedophilic romantic relationships..

I know it sounds so exaggereative and/or trashy, but I didnt expect that manga would push my buttons deep inside, so hard that I would just weep uncontrollably and are having suicidal thoughts due to the tragic content of the manga..

Was I emotionally triggered because of it resonates deep within my subconscious? Or is it just because I long such relationship potrayed in it as a pedophile? Or both?

Passively suicidal,"So I think about death all the time and regularly think about situations where I get hit by like a bus or have terminal cancer, it's so bizarre. Because I'm not actually a risk to myself,  I'm not in any way planning any attempt but as I fall asleep it seems like I'm always thinking about how an exit wound would look at the back of my head.  


I call passive suicidality 'living in the Grey'. It's an inbetween state,  smack bang in the middle of loving life and hating it.  It's so strange because health professionals are always asking if I'm having 'dark thoughts' and it's like,  well,  what really *is* a dark thought? When it comes down to it,  it's the behaviour, the intention, not the thoughts,  that are the true issue.  

Death is always on my mind.  Not just my own,  but anyone and everyone.  I think constantly about different situations where people in my life die tragically,  and how I would grieve.  Would I crumple into a depressed mess or rise to the occasion and be strong for the rest of my family?  Who would care if I died?  So many questions all the time.

"I'm a deadbeat, a total deadbeat, and I can only blame myself for it.","Trans girl, 17 years old. I've sat on my ass and done practically nothing for the past 2 years, got withdrawn at 15 from school due to mom worried that I'd get bullied for being trans, tried homeschooling but fell out of it. I always said that I'm not a true drop-out because I plan on getting into college at some point, but right now I don't even know if that's possible. 

My body is worthless, 6 feet tall and 130 lbs, nobody wants to date a skeleton, and if they do, maybe there is something wrong with them... I can get skinny people, but ones who are bony to the point of concern... I can't get why anyone would be attracted to me. Yet I somehow have a boyfriend. 

My jawline and brow ridge make me look like a fucking Neanderthal, and yet I've been told that I'd pass fine with estrogen, they're all just being nice. They know the crushing, suicidal feeling it is if you're ever told that you can't pass, and they simply don't want me to get pushed over the edge and end it, they're only being nice. 

Haven't gotten a job, haven't even gotten a license, and haven't done anything school related much either. I just sit on my ass and play video games, watch youtube, anime, listen to music, I just do my hobbies, I think about getting off my ass and getting my life back on track but the lack of motivation I have is weighing me down like an anvil tied to my ankles. I just feel no need to...

I'm a joke, and one with a mediocre punchline too. Somebody respectable would have done SOMETHING by now, I've been emotionally abused by my stepfather for a few years but I got over it, so I really can't use that reason or excuse. I could have had a job, had a license and be in college right now, but I can't. Because I lack any motivation, because I don't want my license to say ""male"" or my dead name, because I don't want to be discriminated or humiliated at any public workplaces for being trans, maybe if I wasn't such a lazy pussy, I could have gotten somewhere. 

But nah, I haven't, and it's all because of laziness, lack of motivation, and fear. 6 months to recover? Fair enough, a year? Maybe if it's that serious, but 2 years? Sigh... If there is one word anyone can describe me as, it would be; a failure.

Nearly a year into my gender transition: What I've learned. MtF,"I thought I escaped the depression. From the first dose of my Spiro and Estrogen I felt a huge weight off of my shoulders. It was time to be myself and thrive. I enjoyed it. I no longer needed to hide. After a couple of months I thought I'd try dating. Of course, I expected the hate messages. I expected the slurs. What I never expected was the amount of men that maintained interest after I disclosed that I'm transgender. What I soon found was a pattern. A pattern I could not escape. It was in this moment I realized what being a living fetish is like. 

For the past nine months I've been nothing more to men than a source for pictures and a discreet fun time. I still fall for the player saying he wants something more than hooking up just to be used, ghosted, and hit up when he is drunk and horny. The first few times hurt my ego but I recovered. Having the same story for nine months straight makes me question if this is all that life has for me. 

I want nothing more than to just connect with someone. Talk with a guy about life and get to know each other. But. The only attention I ever get are if I post naughty pics or nudes. Once I show and indication that I'm human they ghost. I've made a few trans friends and the story is the same. Doesn't matter how pretty. How much they pass. We're just a fetish and nothing more. It makes sense why they're all either depressed or escorts.

my mom just gave up on me,"Since I was young, my mom was the only person who took care of me because my dad left when I was a baby. However, during the summer before freshman year, my parents agreed to move in together and share an apartment so that I could have both of my parents. My dad made a clear that he changed for the better and he wasn't gonna be a deadbeat anymore. This arrangement only lasted for about a year and a half, however, because my dad recently moved out two weeks ago.

My dad leaving again hurt a lot because I felt like I didn't build enough of a relationship with him. I never really got to the point where I could tell him personal stuff, especially how I feel about him and his decision to leave again. It's just been adding on stress and anxiety.

Yesterday, the straw that broke the camels back erupted at school, and I ended up in a violent altercation with another student. I pushed him into the wall, and his head started to bleed. A lot. I immediately went to apologize, and he said there was no hard feelings.

I was suspended for five days, and my mom was furious after she found out. Over the last two days, she's been repeatedly telling me that she's given up on me and my dreams. She says the only place I'll ever end up is prison, and I'll never be shit.

goodnight,"I want to live. I'm a little, cheerful girl. I love music. Whenever I'm about to go to sleep, I take my pink mp3 player to my bed and listen to my favorite songs for hours while imagining myself as a skydiver, princess or a superhero! As I dive into the blue sky I scream so loud that my throat hurts. Maybe if I'm loud enough I won't be able to hear my mother's epileptic seizure as the nice paramedic asks me what I've been reading and if school is going good. I try to ignore my grandma crying while my grandfather just looks away from what is happening. School is going good, I'm really enjoying my art classes. The teacher says that I have some potential and that I'm a pleasure to have in class. Maybe because I rarely talk. I like when my teacher praises me, it makes me feel like I'm special - I think as I sit on my bed, with one of my CDs playing in the background.

I'm in middle school. I live in the city now. My school is bigger, more modern and it even has a cafeteria. It's always crowded yet somehow empty at the same time. I no longer have art classes. My teachers say that I'm smart but kind of lazy. All of the girls are so pretty. My cheeks are chubbier than theirs, my legs are thicker and my belly is sticking out. I skip my lunch. Looking at pictures of gorgeous and thin girls on the internet makes me feel full. I hate PE classes. I'm the only girl that can't play volleyball. I hit the ball really hard and now my hoodie is stained red. It hurts but I pretend nothing has happened. Nobody notices. 

High school is scary. Boys don't really like me. Maybe because of the way I dress or because I cut my hair very short. Starving becomes binging. I really hate my thighs. I'm the class clown. I skip school every day for a week. I overdose on medication several times. One time I almost fall down the stairs and pass out in my bathtub after overdosing on some pills. I try to kill myself. When in the ER one of my teachers is there. She looks at me. I can barely stay awake. One of the nurses tells me that I'm selfish. After coming back from hospital my teachers say that I'm the laziest student they've ever had. My mother forces me to lie so they won't put me in a psychiatric facility. I go to the psychiatrist once and never go back. Now my grandma sleeps in my room and they look through my stuff every day. I have to ask to go to the bathroom. My mom makes me stay in the guest room with only a bed, a desk and my textbooks. Dinner tastes awful. I want to die. 

College starts. My major is not that great. I have literature classes. I'm a very average student. Sometimes I remember my elementary school art teacher. I feel like I failed her. Boys still don't like me. My cheeks are still way too chubby. My body is covered in white thick lines. People stare a lot. Some ask questions some just avoid me. I still imagine and fantasize before going to sleep a lot. Skydiving turned into jumping off a bridge into a river, grand parties and colorful dresses turned into lonely college dorms, oversized t-shirts, and old sweaters, I no longer am a superhero, now I'm the one waiting for someone or something to save me. I no longer scream, I no longer put up a fight. I remember loving music but now it just gives me a headache. I'm an almost 21-year-old, tired woman. I no longer want to live.

She has talked to me frequently but it just seems that she doesn't care. One of my friends who I thought was my friend leaked out that I'm autistic and have ADHD as well as I take medications for that every day. Now, whenever I walk around school people look at me and laugh while talking shit about me. Some have called me a freak and leave the school and go to a mental asylum. I've been called a mistake so many times. All this has been affecting me emotionally and physically. This has been making my depression worse and has increased my levels of anxiety. I've been having more anxiety attacks since this all started. Everything around me is starting to become meaningless to me.

It hurts..but I remembered the feelings I had last time I went and saw you. It hurt..I cried myself to sleep. I went to bed hurting and I woke up hurting. Once again I’m left looking dumb to go out of my way to see you. I crossed many busy roads and climbed many tall mountains to just try and please you and I still believe you truly don’t care. It’s hard letting go of the one person that once made you the happiest you had ever been in life. Looking back at when I had you I looked so different. I literally had a glow within me. You gave me that glow that made me shine so bright..you also took it away without any hesitation. I’ve never been the same since then. I’m not sure why I’ve kept you around for 2 more years after we broke up. I know deep down you will never be able to make me shine like you used to..I will never have that glow again. I will never be able to feel that love again..and it simple as to why not..because you don’t love me..you don’t care about me..It’s funny how life works. How the people you would do anything for in this world will do nothing for you. How the ones that once made you so happy now bring darkness into your life. When will one day someone fight for me..fight to keep me seeing me glow...fight to keep me happy..Hopefully soon..but for now as I wait I’ve decided to not cross any busy roads for you or climb any mountains..for now I will stay here even though it hurts I’m safer here by myself than with you.",princessmaeha199920,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fegd3g/choosing_not_to_see_you_this_time/

I just want to end it all but I'm too weak to do it by myself, I see no exit out of this emptiness it got closed. I just hope everyday to die and to forget everything. Or to stop everything for a few years to take a break and get my shit together, but it's just too late. 

I don't even have a family that I could spend my time with, Not even a friend anymore, Not even anyone. Everything is just overwhelming and too much even there is nothing. I can't even cry.

So the thing is I am trying so hard to be happy and ignore the toxic people in life but the thing is I don't have friends, not a girlfriend. This is eating me inside making me awkward around people which gives the weird vibe around people. I am anxious around people which make me a different human which make more difficult to make friends.  

There were some people in my life which I thought would stay around me so I ignored toxicity and thought it will become better but it backfired me because when I tried to talk to them about what they have done to me they turned the table around me and blamed me for all. Now I don't know how to make myself innocent and they have played with my emotions and I want to prove myself and want pay for there deeds

"I tried to kill myself yesterday and wanna quit the meds, long post","So i was at a party and got drunk, not i cant walk drunk, but drunk enough to make my metabolism fast enough to get rid of all the meds in my blood i guess. I just finished high school and at this party were all my classmates and the people i once called friends. 
I thought i could go there and talk to them and try to befriend them again. I miss them so much. Ive always been very shy and i thought i would drink because that makes me all bubbly and stuff, but this time it just did not work, i went right past the bubbly and the very drunk and a mess straight to i feel like i wanna die. This had never happened to me before.
So there i was, kinda off my meds and feeling depressed and there was a pool so in a place no one would notice too fast i started getting in slowly. Then i just jumped. I tried to do it but my body wouldnt all i wanted to do was sink to the bottom and numb everything out and then justgo i guess? But my body wouldnt, i couldnt physically do it.
My parents came and 4 people tried to help. Only one of which i would have expected and its not like i didnt like them i just didnt think they liked me, definatly not enough to help and im sure they will dissapear now, except for the one, but he cant take care of me like i need it. I need someone to be there all the time and i guess thats not fair.
I guess thats not fair, because thats how i lost my friends. They didnt understand i needed someone to be there and i tried to open up but i also need checkups, because i will convince myself im just bothering. 
I wanted one of my friends to help me the most, the one id known the longest, the one i had always been able to come back to, but i didnt get that she just didnt have the time or the will to help me like i needed anymore.
Now i dont wanna take the meds because i truly thought i was better. Turns out i was just drugged all the time and it feels so fake now. I thought i was happy and out of it and that soon enough my doctor would take me off them slowly. That i was starting to understand how not to be depressed, but now i think the only way to do that is to feel it and fight it, not take drugs and make it ""disappear"". Ive always been able to fight, its harder, yes, but i think i can make it.",FinalAbility7,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fefg8r/i_tried_to_kill_myself_yesterday_and_wanna_quit/
forcing myself to appreciate my progress,"Hi! I've been battling depression for the past two years, officially diagnosed in summer 2019, currently on medication &amp; therapy. Beating myself up every. single. day. for just being ""lazy"", and ""not being able to get it together"", as well as struggling with the thought that i somehow just tricked everybody (including the doctors) into thinking that i have depression when really i dont. 🥴  
Anyways, after another horrifying therapy session of me complaining that i am really just a piece of shit that only wants to sleep 24/7, wasting her life away not accomplishing anything, my therapist urged me to list all the things which i do DO and sort of look at them from afar and try to practice gratitude and appreciation. Here it is:

1) most days, I am able to make myself brush my teeth and on the good days even take a shower  
2) i could have given up on all work  to kind of ""sleep through"" my depression (my partner can support me financially with no trouble) however as tempting as it is I still do the work (working remotely from home) and recently took on a big project, which I was debating declining but still didn't (no idea how and if  im going to handle it but ill update you on here)  
3) roughly once a week I may feel like putting on makeup and doing my nails  
4) i am able to socialize with my best friend and truly enjoy our evenings together, which is a huge one  
5) i am now able to recognise that the meds do really help and I stopped having hysterical breakdowns and intrusive, disturbing thoughts  
6) i have never missed a day of therapy  
7) even though my sleep schedule is non-existence (sleeping every 4 hours during the course of a day) I still pull myself out of bed, have breakfast, maybe out on some clothes and go out to work in a cafe, even if for just an hour

My parents always thought I was lazy,"as the title states my parents always thought I was lazy in my highschool days, but I was just unbelievably depressed. Can anyone else relate? 

was I lazy at times? Hell yea brother but isn’t everyone at some point? They’d call me lazy if I hung out in my bedroom, didn’t shower, ect went on for all my highschool days even when I was on a football team my whole highschool life never came home till 6 and was gone Friday/Saturday nights out with friends, cleaned up as much as a teenager does. 

My point being why didn’t my parents ever sit me down and talk to me and explain it? I remember having tears coming down my face as 14 year old me held a knife in the kitchen as my step dad walked towards the laundry room I had a sigh of relief that someone would help but he didn’t mention it or see me or talk to me. I feel like if they would’ve just sat me down after seeing these signs they’d know and I’d be way better developed then I am now cause I’m just learning these things now. I had no idea it was even depression I thought something was wrong with me, still do till this day. They determined I was the quiet one and didn’t like to talk much but up until highschool I never had that problem, I felt like I got sunk into a depression and never really came out of it and now I’m stuck being profiled as this guy I’m not, even when I speak I get spoken over like it’s a primal thing or them trying to shun my words? 

I don’t want people to think my parents where bad they were great but I just don’t understand it at all. For me when I have kids I’d make sure to see the quiet signs

I'm a mess right now,"I have no one to listen to my problems so I thought I would write them down. Then I decided to post it on here. 

Just moved to a new city and started at a new school. I don't miss anything from my old hometown, I'm actually quite happy to be somewhere else. Moving has been tough though. I had to give up my cat and say goodbye to my friends.

I have kind of 'joined' a group of friends at school. They're all pretty nice. The dynamic of the group is a little weird though. Its like 50% introverts who don't talk much, myself included, and 50% strongly opinionated extroverts. They mostly seem like a nice group of people though. In regard to making friends, things have gone pretty well. Trying to form deep relationships with people is a hard and long process though. It's hard not to get impatient and blame myself though. I feel like I'm being ungrateful because even though I think I've been lucky in finding a group of friends, which is exactly what I want, I still feel so shit.

I've never been diagnosed but I think I could have depression and/or anxiety. I would love to get some medication if it would ease the pain, but I don't want to tell my parents how I feel.

Over the past few years I've thought of suicide probably at least once a month, usually weekly or daily though, and planned it two or three times in my life. I've been thinking about it a lot recently. I've been researching pills I can get at a chemist that I could overdose on and I've found a suicide bridge that's very close to my house. I've been told that I should live for all the good moments in life, but the effort it takes to reach those moments doesn't seem worth it sometimes.

I'm starting to find it hard to trust myself. I'm like a different person from day to day, or even hour to hour. During the brief moments when I feel happy about something I worry about my emotions causing me to do something I regret. When I'm sad or empty it's all I can think about.

There's this girl who's not in my new social circle but who has been really nice to me. She seems like a really nice person. We don't see each other much but she always makes an effort to greet me. I'm unsure whether her intentions are romantic or platonic and it's making me dizzy. I really want us to become better friends or maybe more, but I am not great at social interaction and always make myself feel shit about every little mistake I make. I feel kind of like It'll never happen, yet I spent the whole afternoon texting her. I feel like I'm going insane.

The people I admire most are the ones that seem like the nicest people you could ever know and make you feel happy just being present or after a short conversation and you're always left wanting more from them. I aspire to be like this and make other people happy. I need to remember to smile more though.

Usually I have a high libido but the past two weeks my drive has literally been non-existent. A month ago my shit suddenly became sloppy even though my diet is quite healthy and hasn't changed much, I think it is anxiety causing me to be extremely tense all the time. I just started waking up at 4am every morning out of nowhere and I can't stop. I don't know what the fuck is happening to me.

I feel so lonely. I just want someone to talk to and listen to. Getting to that point with someone new takes time and I'm getting kind of impatient.

I don't know what to do to make myself happy. If things worked out with this girl I think I would be happier, yet the thought of her losing interest in me makes me feel awful.

Missing the sadness,"I suffered with depression for many years, and haven recently reached a turning point in my life where I finally feel good again, but somethings a little off, all my emotions are less extreme, sadness passes in minutes now and is nowhere near the intensity is was before, but I feel this weird longing to feel an emotion to that same depth and extreme again, has anyone else experienced this? Or am I going mad?
It’s like I was so used to the emotion everything else feels uncomfortable now.

I feel so stupid for feeling like this, I’m lucky enough to (it appears so far) gotten past the darkness that defined my teens and early adulthood, and I have this sick lust to feel it again?

It also come with this constant creeping fear that this ‘ok’ness I’m feeling now is a facade, that soon something will happen and I will fall back into my old state instantly.

The conflict of this fear and the longing is driving me a little mad.
I can’t talk to anyone I know about it because I’m pretty sure I’m gonna sound insane, so I guess I’m asking you guys.

Complete dissatisfied human being.,"So I‘m a bit excited about writing a post about it. I‘m struggling from severe depression since I‘m 11. I‘m also not the one who‘s crying over things happened in the past. It’s about my condition I‘ve been living with the last years and want some advices about how to finally be able to handle it.

Everyday I wake up with great dissatisfaction. Always in a bad mood. No motivation at all. Always tired and sleepy and feeling totally lost. I‘ve lost interest in nearly everything - drawing, music, singing... Not knowing what to do, I fear the future ahead of me. I was once totally into Design... thought this is what I‘m going to do. However, I‘ve also lost the interest in it. It was a gradual change and I can’t even explain why it happened since I was always passionate about it. 

Now I‘m sitting there - day by day - everything is annoying, not interesting anymore, not worth it and stressful to me. I feel like I fell into an Abyss with my head full of negative thoughts. I don’t know who I am neither am I satisfied with how the situation isn’t changing. I tried meditation once. It was a good experience. But I‘m not even in the mood to continue what might help me out of this situation. The only thing I’m currently doing is just playing games the whole day so I won’t be confronted with all those bad thoughts flooding my mind.

Don’t get me wrong. I’m really grateful for what I have. Being able to sleep on a bed, having enough food and embracing the small things in live. I don’t like it fancy. I just want to find happiness and being able to laugh again.

Medication works!!!,"I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression right now and I have been taking prescription meds for the last couple weeks. It really helps! 

A little background- I got out of a 6 year relationship due to not seeing a future with my ex in December 2019. And then one person who I thought was really close friend of mine, decided he did not want to be friends with me anymore and cut all contacts with me. I get emotionally attached wayyy too easily and this led to me having anxiety, panic attacks and depression - which eventually led to insomnia, IBS, migraines and constant body aches. 

I started therapy in feb 2020 and have been since going to my therapist every week. And my therapist suggested I look at options for medication and try it. So since the last 2 weeks, I’m on Lexapro (SSRI) and my psychiatrist did tell me that it is going to take a few weeks to see changes. But for the last 3/4 days I have been observing that my energy levels have increased because I have been able to sleep well and it is so much better. My IBS has decreased and I haven’t got any migraines. I’m really really glad the medication is helping. If anyone is out there looking of options, and one the fence of trying medication, go for it.

Just need to vent.,"My depression has been at its worst recently and I’ve been trying desperately to find a therapist. The people I usually go through have told me it’s a 9 month waiting list and I honestly don’t think I’ll be able to wait that long so they suggested someone else. I checked their website and applied for therapy and managed to book an assessment appointment for next month. I slept easier last night at the thought that I’d be getting help soon only to wake up this morning to a notification on my phone saying they had cancelled my appointment as they no longer help people in my area. 

I’m just so sick of trying to help myself. I know it’s not their fault for not being able to help me, but just that brief feeling of hope meant so much to me. They shouldn’t allow people to apply if they aren’t going to be able to help or at least have a warning up. Everywhere I’ve looked so far has said to either wait, go to A&amp;E or call 111 IF it’s an emergency. What classifies as an emergency? Because I’m almost certain I wouldn’t be considered one and I don’t want to waste their time considering the NHS is already stretched thin.

Before I say what I came here to ask here's alittle backstory...

Backstory - throughout my mom's pregnancy the doctors were absolutely sure I was to be born a healthy baby girl, but somewhere along the line something unexpected happened and I came out not only a boy (according to what I've been told and what's written on my birth certificate) I was also unfortunate enough to be born with cleft lip, cleft palette, asthma, droopy eyes(don't know if that's the clinical term, but basically up until I was 8 or 10 [can't remember] I was unable to open my eyes all the way), and various other problems. I have always felt like I should not have been born a boy let alone live past 3 weeks (another failed diagnosis, lucky me right?). 

My childhood consisted of doing stuff to get attention but really all I wanted was to be liked a very hard thing to do when you are basically physically retarded and cannot talk like everyone else and constantly being reminded how you are such a failer that you couldn't even be born right. Since my conciousness first made its way into this world I have found myself thinking as a girl, along with thinking how much better litterally my life would have been if I managed to get it right. My dad was never in the picture so growing up without a father has been difficult on its own, but of course I was informed my dad had the chance to come to America when I was born because of my condition, but he declined to start a new family and I'm sure he had other reasons. My mom always worked all the time so it was pretty much me and my older brother for some time. An older brother that constantly made fun of me along with my mom for how I talked and how I acted. My brother constantly calling me gay, faggot, bitch, you name it he's done it. I'm sure he was unaware of how I felt inside but it traumatized me so much I am afraid of being myself. My body is not shaped how normal guy's are either so I have no idea how to take that problem. At school o was labeled the retarded kid no one liked.

Once I turned 11 my mom met a man, let's call him D. D was/is military and I later found out they got married quick (span of a few months) to finance my surgeries because I came from a background of poverty being single parent with 2 kids (later 3). I was always treated like a pet and always had the harshest and most frequent punishments. I was always forced to do everything for everybody else. My brother had to go do something like talk to a neighbor to get the bike fixed, I had to do it, stuff like that. To this day I get asked by family to buy their plane tickets or order them stuff cause they ""don't know how"". I have always been used all my life. I am nothing but a tool. As I patiently waited for the surgeries that I was supposed to get (atleast just the one to fix my nose and make me look somewhat normal) when I was 12, then delayed to 16, then 18, and finally at 19. I received the first surgery and all they did was make my life a living hell. 

Medical history - The doctor messed up my nose and now theres a glasses size gap on the bridge of my nose, for the tip of it they put cartalage from my side [which they lied to me and took it out of under my right chest] is fat which I didn't even care about having in the first place I just wanted my nose to be straight and deal with the rest later. I was put in a maxillary distractor (fancy name for cage on my head). To move my upper jaw forward so that they can reconstruct the palate (roof of my mouth) and straighten jaw or whatever they were doing I have no clue and it seemed unnessesary to me. It did however improve my speech just a tiny bit. I had to wear this crap o. My head for 4 months. Later I then made my own appointments 2 years later (22) and got a surgery for bonegraft. I am still missing the tooth implant which I cannot afford nor will I ever be able to, and I have to have another surgery on my nose again. I have always suffered from depression because of this but not only because of my unfortunate medical circumstances. (Also I have been getting pains around my abdominal area so either I've got something going on down there that shouldn't be or when I was born the doctors decided it be best to stick a penis on me and call me a boy).

As for the other reasons why I'm highly depressed and on the verge of collapsing. I was forced by my stepdad to go into debt. I wanted to go to college but I wanted to do it like everyone else, a real place surrounded by real people so I can maybe make atleast one friend and not be a total failer. Of course my luck hits home again and he forced me to go to an online college with the promiss of letting me use the money the army provides to him for school use. I agree and then he turns and days ""yea no... Do it yourself"". Landing me 16k debt that I can't pay, 3k I was forced to pay (just to get my diploma) and 3k my mom was forced to pay for me to be able to enroll in classes. Before this though I was planning to join the military to get a one up on life, but apparently not God's plan. Since when I brought up the idea he straight refused. I was not allowed to work or go out, I did not have an allowance or any type of money except money I got for my birthday ($20 every year, ages 18-19-20) and it didn't help that I had no friends up until senior year in highschool (that summer is the only happy memories I have after leaving my home town. He was very controlling that's why I feel I can't do anything without the constant reminder of all the trauma I've faced.

I did however keep the promis I made to myself about joining the military. Unfortunately though I was not let in. After two years of waiting and providing all of the medical paperwork I was finally sent to MEPS for the Marines, finally a chance for me to straighten out my life and man up and get all these rediculous thoughts and feelings out my head. NOPE! Once I get there I take the ASVAP and score on the higher side (I know right smarts actually came in handy I might look like a retard but my mental capacity is on the higher side) scored 80. Go through medical everything good up until the physical, the doctor asks me if I always been tall and skinny (I have a very feminine body besides the lack of breasts and having a penis) I say yes, normal ok cool then I go to the eye exam and they tell me I have astigmatism in my left eye (this I knew it happened when I was about 5 or so, started hallucinating and seeing giant spiders with extream detail) I went to see if I can get this fixed they said and I quote ""the damage to your eye is so savire that we do not have the equipment required to even make a dent of progress, the best solution I can offer is to use the effected eye and hope it gets better over time, sorry but there is nothing we can do for you at this time."" - Lasik doctor. So dream job at Marines = no go. The MEPS people tell me to try the army cause they accept pretty much anyone. I do and same thing they say I can't join because of my stupid eye, gee thanks God. 

At this point I start thinking maybe it's not meant to be and give up. 

My job history is halarious, atleast to me. Almost even didn't get hired. First job at age 20, McDonald's. Mom gets a house with my brother who got to live my fantasy of being in the military and travel the world, who then decides to mock me and make my life even worse by deciding he needs a surgery on his penis (he thought it was so curved he can't have sex yet he never tried, now he's depressed and thinks he can never have it and the doctor messed up, doctor also gave him circomsition) this happened during my attempt at joining the Marines. Throughout the course of 6 months he would constantly scream at the top of his lungs and say how God hates him, this is punishment, lash out at me for no reason, and make me feel not only unsafe but want to take my own life even more just to get out of that situation. Once we move into the new house this continues along with me every day for months on end calming him down explaining and telling him to be patient cause it's not gunna heal right away and healing of the body depends on the mind state anyways. Because of the move I am forced to quit my job that I actually enjoyed, to transfer to another McDonald's on the side of town we moved to (two towns down) I work there for 6 months before quitting because of how unfairly I was being treated, everything was my fault, I never did anything right, I was lazy, the works (even though I did mainly everybody's job in the kitchen, everyday I washed the grill swept mopped multiple times a day, I would be on grill then on the table making the burgers, I'd go and get the 50 pound boxes from the freezer. You name it I did it.) I eventually quit after 6 months bought a one way ticket to California and said my goodbyes to my brother who called my mom crying saying I left and he tried to stop me... I was sick of his shit. I had shit I was dealing with all my life and now I have to deal with you and your problem too, (excuse the langauge but) fuck outta here with that shit. 
I have so little control over my own life that I only spent 2 days in California before my mom told the entire family where I was and got my aunt (grandma's sister so technically grandma, who's also a nun) to somehow convince me to go to New York and stay with my uncle. I can't believe I actually fell for their stupid guilt trip but somehow after only 5 days I was off to NYC. I told myself it's probably best since there are lots of opportunities for me to be a musican. Wrong. I was basically plummited into the same exact situation with different people. Greedy money hungry aunt, no jobs, no money, an uncle who works at night sleeps durring the day, wierd daughter that turned into her mother. I had to get outta there it got to the point where she was looking through my stuff while I wasn't there to find proof I could pay her $700 to stay in the shitty, stinky room they kept rabbits in. With a door that locks from the outside and a broken window, very small room at that. After two months of looking for jobs while making music simaltaniously I am being called a liar I good for nothing a lazy bum you name it that's what she labeled me. I manage to get a job at McDonald's again but in NY. I manage to set up the bonegraft appointment and lay on an air mattress for two weeks feeling useless and being called useless. I go back to work and then move into my grandpa's room he was renting. Lucky for me he was on vacation for the next two months. Durring this time when my granpa came back j felt obligated and wanted to help with his bills ultimately giving him what little I had. 4 months pass and after much consideration and mom/brother begging for me to come back I oblige. 
I then get a job at another McDonald's in the next town over oppisate direction with the help of my old boss. I work there for 6 months before quitting because of the same drama the first time and hearing people continuously talking shit about me making me feel terrible about myself even more and with the emense parinoia I was experiencing due to smoking too much (the parinoia was about how I hid the fact I'm not normal and that I wish to be a girl and intricate details of my life).

If you think that's it well your wrong... My aunt comes to the USA on a visa and is put in a shit situation feeling unsafe, according to her. My mom is the only one in the USA she knows, mom folds and buys her a plane ticket to stay here for the time being, money my mom didn't have, which is fine desperate times desperate measures and such. She stays here for an entire month and quickly realises there is nothing here, everything is far and you have to drive everywhere. The time that she was here I could have used to work on my music the 3 hours I was left alone in the house, but no. 
Everything that she bought or well made me buy she complains and says it's for someone else, complains she didn't buy anything for herself and how she had to use my mom's clothes cause instead of buy things for herself she bought for everyone else supposedly. She then says how she needs a phone and makes me go find one for her. After I go through the trouble of finding and iPhone 7 plus for a crazy deal ($150) which they usually go for 300-350 I go and I borrow money to go get her the phone. She then says oh... I wanted a more modern one....like yours.... I'm like ugh ok I reset mine give her it and she then says she will give me the 150 (my phone was iPhone X pristine condition). Months pass I still don't have a job (stopped looking to focus on getting my licence), everybody keeps making excuses not to teach me, and the piece of crap car that my brother was going to pass down to me needs a new battery so I can't use it, and he also decided to retract the offer before I got the chance to use it and is selling it because he doesn't want to pay for it. He is not rich but wealthy $40k in the bank meanwhile I'm 30k in debt 12 of which collectors are being sent now. 

Debt - borrowed money I didn't have to help pay bills to not be called worthless and useless. Borrowed too much then took 5k out and ran away to California

That brings me to the present day, some details have been left out as to not make this extreamly long.
(Side note: I have always liked girls but it's more like an admiration/envy type of thing, always wishing I was one cause I always felt just wrong in my own body)

Ok TL;DR shit life should have been born a girl, instead I came out with so many problems and mental issues along with the traumatizing circumstances I was put in and the problems still continue.",annonymisskd,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fecspk/my_life_story_i_am_sorry_its_so_long/
I hate my life,"I hate my life so much I would be better off dead I feel, everyday is the same and nothing in life gets better, and the few friends I have seen to not like me anymore, a lot of them don’t talk to me at all and my school friends seem like they don’t like me anymore and I found out a lot of them talking shit about me that I thought were my friends, and I already got bullied for half the year. 

I don’t wanna live anymore, and I can’t even see a doctor even though I have the legal right to one there is none available and walk in clinics are useless. Canada has shit healthcare 

My grades are so bad and I’m disappointment to my parents. At this point I wanna just drown my problems with drugs. 

Me and my gf keep fighting and having problems and she just moved to a new school and told me how “everyone’s been so nice especially the boys” and like that’s troubled me because I’m ugly and I have nothing to offer with my personality so I feel like any guy is better for her than I am but I need her.

I want help but there’s no one to help me I’m so done.

I just want to go home,"28F. My husband wanted to move from West coast to the East coast. Here we are 5 months later. I hate my job and most coworkers. I met a coworker I loved but she ended up leaving and now I have nothing to look forward to at work. I eat in my car I'd rather eat by myself than with gossiping, whining women.

My husband has always been a people person so hes made friends pretty quick. There's days were hes out and I'm sitting home alone.   

So alone. I cry in secret. I keep things to myself idk where I've gotten the idea that I need to be strong and crying is weakness.

I tried talking to my husband last  night and I was having a hard time talking. He ended up leaving and just sleeping in the livingroom which didnt help this situation. 

I miss my mom
I miss my sister
I really fuckin miss my friends. God do I miss thier hugs so damn much

I can't see myself past 25. I am now 25.,"For the longest time, I couldn't see myself living past 25. This mostly came about towards the last year of University and got worse around the end of 2017, when I wasn't landing work. 

In 2018, I met someone and suddenly I felt alive again. I felt calm and collected. Although I was stuck in the same loop of applying for work, it didn't feel as tiresome. In 2019, I got accepted into medicine and moved overseas. My partner starts tearing us apart 3 weeks into my move... I drop out of med school because the stresses from the break up became way too much to handle. Especially since I was overseas.

Now I am back to applying for jobs in my old degree and getting nowhere. I am heavily depressed. I can't see myself past 25 again. I have this strong feeling I will die this year. 

Atm, I welcome death with open hands... I am tired of life constantly shifting on me. :'(",Iamoriginalthrowaw4y,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/feebpw/i_cant_see_myself_past_25_i_am_now_25/
Hey,"I posted it here and people didn't believe me back then, I cared about it before but I don't care anymore.

I'm serving in the military and I feel shit about it.
I feel broken inside, I changed in a very bad way.

I started having brake-downs and even wetting the bed.

I feel embarrassed, ashamed, and the worse part is that I still have 2 years left (I served 1 year so far).

I haven't told anyone about wetting the bed as I'm not 4 years old. And frankly speaking I just don't want to think about it.

I'm thinking about just ending it sometimes... But I don't want to cause my family and friends any unnecessary sorrow.

I hate it. I hate myself. I hate my life.

Is it bad that I hate being around my family,I hate being around my family I get uneasy and start to get irritated. Both my dad and mom were alcoholics and physically and emotionally abusive in the past. Now I don’t even talk to them and when I do it’s in a robotic tone. I don’t hate my parents and I do sometimes feel bad for not being close to them but I can’t ignore how I feel. I don’t enjoy their company but I want the best for them. And before you judge me and call me a selfish son I wanna let you know that I’ve been beat with wires and fist my feet hands and mouth were once taped while I was beat. The abuse stopped when I started fighting back. They are also very controlling my mom is always on my back always hovering over me and I’m kinda annoyed by her she treats me like a little boy and like I can’t do nothing for myself.

I'm Sorry,"I think the hardest part about depression is watching it drain the people surrounding you.

i’m happy and it feels wrong,"i’ve struggled with depression for about 6-7 years (pre- high school. now i’m a sophomore in college). a lot of my sadness has come from relationships, being stuck in a shitty town, having friends but not having any GOOD friends, blah blah. i can confidently say i’m over my most recent breakup and i don’t really have any crushes on anyone, so that part of my depression has kinda weirdly disappeared? i don’t live at home so i finally have the freedom to go wherever and do whatever i want. i have the best friends i could ask for and some awesome roommates. my classes this semester are so low stress it’s kind of annoying and i’ve picked up new hobbies that are fun and make me feel good. 

but now i have a new problem. i’m happy. i think i’m like actually happy, or at least i’m content with how my life is going currently. but it feels wrong? i feel like i shouldn’t be happy and i feel guilty for feeling this way. i can’t remember one time in my life where i felt like this and it’s scary. like really scary. a very small part of me wants to go back and do something drastic to send me into another depression. but at the same time i’m like, no this is what you’ve been wanting your whole life don’t fuck it up now! just enjoy it! but it’s hard to enjoy because now i’m uncomfortable. this is all foreign and new and i don’t like it. sure, i was sad all the time before and could barely muster the energy to get out of bed and shower or eat, but as least i was comfortable. 

has anyone else ever felt like this? i feel kinda shitty for being uncomfortable and i just wanna know i’m not alone. i totally understand if i get 0 sympathy (like, who complains about being content with life?), but i really feel wrong. it’s like i lost a huge defining piece of myself and now i have no idea who i’m supposed to be or how i’m supposed to act without it.",zxndxr,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/feakna/im_happy_and_it_feels_wrong/
Better days coming.,"So I’ve struggled with depression on and off my whole life. I graduated recently and was lucky enough to land a pretty decent job. However, since I’ve moved and started the job I’ve relapsed heavy. I know it’s common for people to be lonely when making a big move and being in a new environment. I tried to end it all when I was in hs and told myself I would never go back to that place. I decided to get help a few months ago when those thoughts came back and I’m glad I did. I won’t bore you with all the details but work was the reason for a lot of my issues so i decided to be proactive and change it. Well today i just got an offer at a company that I’ve wanted to work at since I started college! And best of all it’s back in the same town as all my friends who graduated with me. I know I will be happy there, more so than this place. And I’ll be surrounded by people who made me enjoy my life for those short 4 years. I’m hoping this was the change that I was looking for. I made every excuse as to why nothing would get better and to just live it out. I start next month!

Btw I signed up for BetterHelp for my therapy. It’s not for everyone but I’m very shy and have had bad experiences with psychiatrist and counselors. It was just more excuses I made to not get help.",Earwaxking,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fehh65/better_days_coming/

Getting pummeled from all sides,"I'm drowning over here. I'm failing every single person in my life, being criticized by every single person in my life, being controlled by every single person in my life, and I don't know how to deal.

My abusive ex is fighting for custody of our daughter. He'll be granted overnights in a few weeks, when he's never spent more than six hours with her. She's going to be so scared. She's too young to understand why her mom isn't there. I've tried suggesting we transition slowly but he's refusing to do so unless I give him six more hours a week, ""in good faith.""

I have two weeks to pay $2k to a court appointed person, that I didn't ask for and can't get rid of, or I'll be held in contempt of court, resulting in a fine or jail time, even though I'm unemployed for another couple months. My dad is well able to help, but won't, because he ""doesn't want to get involved,"" but not because he isn't financially able.

My boyfriend is completely minimizing AND demonizing my feelings. Every single time I point out a problem, he plays victim and turns it around on me. When he picks on me and it hurts my feelings, I just need to toughen up and trust that he doesn't mean it. When I get upset that he tells me what to do, I just need to let go of this hatred for imagined authority. When he's super stressed to the point of being 85% negative all the time and I'm feeling neglected and unloved because of it, I just need to keep my feelings to myself because he doesn't need guilt on top of his stress.

My baby has been sick so she hasn't been sleeping well. She woke up at 4:30 this morning, when she normally gets up at 6:30, and I was trying to get her back down. Well I also live with my parents. And my stepdad told my mom that I was yelling at my daughter and stomping around the room to intimidate her, which isn't at all true. When I told my boyfriend that I was being stern with her, not yelling, he said that maybe I should change my stern voice because apparently it scares people. 

So yes, let me just do whatever the fuck everyone wants me to do and be who they want me to be because I have no autonomy or authority over my over damn life. Let me stop expressing my emotions, which means stop having emotions all together, to please all these fuckers in my life. Let me change something I don't even feel I'm doing *wrong* just to make someone else fucking happy.

And if I'm not happy?

Well, that's just too bad! Because apparently everyone else's feelings matter but mine.

I don't want to die, but I can't fucking live like this. Every waking moment of my life is just trying to please someone else. It's putting everyone else above me because if I don't, I'll be chastised or belittled or berated. No one can just let me be me and do what I do because they think they have some fucking hold on me and should be able to control what I do and say and think and feel.

I can't fucking LIVE like this. Who fucking can? But there's no way out. I'm unemployed until the summer. So I have to live with my parents. I have to listen to their bullshit. I can't get my ex to stop stalking me and harassing me and insulting me. The court is refusing to hold him accountable. I can't force my dad to keep me out of jail for something I have zero control over. I can't get my boyfriend to be more considerate of my feelings, but I can't break up with him either because then I'll *completely* fall apart. Those good moments with him are literally the only things keeping me functioning.

I honestly feel like if I didn't have skin, I'd be shattered. Not even just shattered, in pieces. Like a broken piece of tempered glass, split into so many pieces that they're impossible to count, and I get cut by them every single time I move. Just a walking, breathing flesh bag of blood and fragments.

"Chronic Harm OCD sufferer experiencing awful depression, advice?","Hello. Depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe Harm OCD. But since my relationship ended 8 months ago, I've been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy/tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly. In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything.

I am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through. The years ahead fill me with dread (I'm in my 30s). With my Harm OCD I have a huge hatred of myself anyway, but lately things have just got so heavy.

My friend saved my life today,"You’ve probably haven’t heard from me since I made that concerning post awhile ago, then me deleting it. Welp I’m alive still, but I was very close to ending it today. My head was spiraling more than I’ve ever felt, and light started to blur and noise was distorted. Keep in mind, I wasn’t dying or gaining out of consciousness, I was just walking around my school and I heard the noise of a helicopter, while the sunset was gleaming in my eye. I was just trying to find that damn helicopter since that noise was just consuming me, and my whole world was vanishing, and I lost my meaning completely. I just wanted to end it. I didn’t know how, but I knew I wouldn’t be alive tomorrow. My mind was gone.

I then sat down and cried. Through the hole of the tables outside, I saw a pair of converse. While crying and trying to hide my tears from the cheer team that just got back from practice, I saw friend’s converse who had just came back from 711. They were surprised to see me there, and gave me the rest of their iced coffee. They didn’t know I was crying since I played it off that I was sleeping. We spent another 30 minutes eating brownies and talking about our day.

I don’t think I’ve ever appreciated a person so much in my life. I never knew that the person who saved me would be the one I would least expect.

Should I pull the trigger?,"Was freaking out yesterday, broke crap and screamed and cussed about his money problems and stuff, then calmed down. Well he’s back at it again today.

Saying that I should do more to help out cause he apparently thinks I can keep up by myself with our two story house and doesn’t realize I’m depressed cause he’s an idiot.

First Therapy Sessions: sliding scale?,"Hi

I'm going to be seeing a therapist for the first time in a while, at the urging of my partner. For a long time, I've felt like my problems did not warrant a therapy session, so I am just now taking my situation more seriously. I can't continue on like this and I know it. so I'm going.

My problem is that I have minimal insurance (500$ for the year for mental health). My new therapist works on a sliding scale, but I don't know how much to pay. She's given me 100$ as an option, then I got overwhelmed and she told me to think about what I thought was fair. I might be able to get on my partner's insurance at some point, but I have no idea when,

I'm now terrified of not being able to afford therapy, because I can feel myself getting close to a breaking point.

I spent 4 years with my ex who was severely depressed and had suicidal tendencies at his worst points. I tried so hard to be there for him but I eventually gave up when he forced me to leave him because he knew I would be better off without him. 

Now I’m with my current boyfriend, who has been amazing and my rock, but he just revealed that his cuts are actually his own doing. I’ve only seen it twice. He’s a normal happy guy with some family troubles, sometimes financial but he handles things rather well and optimistically. It’s hard to gauge him at times because he’s generally a happy guy but he breaks down easily when things start to pile on, understandably so. He is nowhere near how I would describe someone who is depressed, but now I’m not so sure because of the SH.

I'm afraid to try a different treatment that might really help me.,"So my depression is *very* treatment-resistant. I've lost track of how many different meds and med combos I've tried. Recently it was suggested that I try TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), which has been proven to be effective for depression like mine. My psychiatrist referred me to the doctor who does it, but I've been putting off actually making the appointment because I'm scared.

You know how sometimes people don't like taking meds because they make them feel like they're not themselves anymore; like they make them feel numb or empty? It's sort of like that, except in reverse. I've had my depression for well over a decade, more than half my life, and I literally can't imagine what it'd be like if it actually got better. Would I still feel like me? I know that things would improve, obviously, but change is scary, and in a bizarre way, my depression is comfortable. It's been a constant for most of my life and I don't know who I'd be without it.

Where to go?,"Hi, 

As the title suggests, where to go or how to help yourself where my options are severely limited?
My GP can only organise pills for me. I have no way of acquiring a therapist. I have been severely depressed for past couple of weeks and mildly since about November.

I don't have a trusted parent, sibling or a friend that I could open up to. I tried a while ago but I ask to support me in functioning day to day, pushing me to work and they just tell me they're sorry or they wish they could help. You know, the empty ""You can talk to me, it will get better"". Then they cut contact. My boyfriend just says he doesn't know how to help me and has phases of randomly complimenting me or texting me to tell me he loves me for two days straight then he forgets all about it. I'm sure he tries his best but I just wish I had more support and he says ""he can't help me anymore than he does"" everytime. I feel so trapped. I always have to pretend I'm fine. I always cover up with humor. It seems like I'm insincere or dramatic when I finally snap and just say I'm a mess. 

I can't afford a therapist. My university counselling office won't help me. They offered a suicide hotline numbers (?) and  ""we're sorry but this isn't a psychological support that we do here"".

"I’m 21, just recently realized my dad is a terrible person and my childhood fucked me up more than anyone can see. I feel hopeless and have no life skills. Think my family is cursed(?)","My dad is an immigrant and came the US in his 30’s after he married my 18 year old mother who was studying abroad in his home country.

He quickly became financially successful and moderately famous in his industry. Things that came to define him above anything else.

My parents had me 11 years into their marriage and I have no siblings. 

I was homeschooled for most of my childhood and super sheltered from everything in life. Never allowed to have sleepovers, rarely allowed to have friends over, had every moment of my life scheduled and micromanaged.  I was never encouraged to pursue anything except becoming a professional soccer player (which was never what I wanted to do, but something my dad wanted me to do as a way to live out his dreams through me vicariously.) 

He was never around. He financially supported me and my mom and lived in the same city as us most of the time, but was never there to parent me and was rarely even around on holidays or birthdays. He kept his things at our house, but came home maybe once a month, sometimes less. He always said he needed to be closer to work so he was staying at his friend’s house (everything in the whole city is a 30 minute drive or less, and he never worked for anyone but himself.) 

Now that I’m an adult, I understand he was living with various girlfriends though he was still married to my mom, and she always seemed to be waiting up for him to come home and finally be a dad/husband. 

I developed severe anorexia at 12, and my family seemed to ignore it even though I stopped growing, lost 40 pounds, was rarely eating, and was exercising 4-6 hours a day. When I was literally weeks away from death with a BMI of &lt;12, my mom finally took me to a doctor after my grandma begged her to because “something was really wrong with me.” The doctor told her I was  anorexic and recommended in-patient treatment and psychotherapy. My mom yelled at the doctor, said “there’s no way MY daughter is anorexic,” and stormed out of the office. 

For the next 6 months or so, I stayed at the same weight and, nightly, would sit down at the dinner table with my mom and cry for hours while she screamed at me to finish my food. I never went to therapy for the eating disorder and she denied every doctor who told her I was mentally ill. She was SURE I had tapeworms, a thyroid disease, celiac, or some other ailment that had caused me to lose 40% of my body weight. I stayed at a dangerously low weight until I was 16, which is the first year I went to school, and traded my ED for nightly sneaking out, binge drinking, and bulimia. 

When I was 16, I was almost arrested for trying to buy alcohol, and my dad found out and told me if I wanted alcohol I could just ask him. He started helping me sneak out and giving me alcohol whenever I wanted. I think he did this to drive a wedge between my mom and me, he always loved to have secrets that we would keep from her. He would take me around his 23 year old girlfriend and tell me to not tell my mom. In fact, he would blackmail me, saying things like “don’t tell mom about so and so, you would hate for her to find out about you sneaking out and partying right?” 

When I was 17, my dad lost all his businesses and wealth, and has still been unable to recover from the financial loss. He pinned all his happiness on money, and once it was gone he changed completely. Every time I’ve talked to him since then, all he’s talked about is how broke he is and how my mom caused his financial ruin and what a stupid idiot she is. He curses my mom around me almost every time he talks to me.

He had a long talk with me one night when I was 16. He told me that I should never have kids because they’ll ruin my life. He never wanted kids. He would be a multi millionaire and so happy and free if he had never had a family. My mom is a crazy lunatic and has only ruined his life and finances. 

I fell into a horribly abusive, 4 year relationship with a guy when I was 17. I bounced around from college to vocational school, and also had a moderately successful entertainment career. I’ve never been able to find footing anywhere. I feel like I can’t connect with anyone. I really don’t feel passion for anything and don’t feel like there’s any path in life that I want to take, though I do feel like I’m talented in multiple things. I’m awful at romantic relationships and friendships (maybe because I never had a healthy relationship example from my family, and never had long term friendships when I was growing up?) 

About a year ago, I was talking with my dad about how I wanted to get a job that made a lot of money like bottle service. He suggested I become a stripper. And so I did. I danced for a year, and he insisted I call him and tell him how much money I made every night, and he acted like I was so lucky because he “gave me permission” to do this. Like wtf I’m a grown adult who’s been living on my own since 18, and god knows I was putting in the work all on my own for all the money I made. 

Every time I see him he’s so negative and toxic and I realize now that a lot of the anxiety and problems I felt as a child (I’ve been suicidal literally since I can remember) stemmed from the insane toxic energy that always engulfed my family life. 

I’ve done a lot of psychedelics, and I really do have a good grip on spirituality and mindfulness, and know there’s something way bigger than this earth plane we live on. There are light forces and dark forces. The thing is, lately, I just don’t feel like I am meant to be blessed by the light forces. Like I was born out of darkness from a cursed family, and I am doomed to be miserable, depressed, and toxic just like my dad. He is not a good person. I think he’s a narcissistic sociopath and it scares me that half of my genes come from that. 

His dad was a total narcissist, no respect for women, I felt unexplainably awful vibes from him always. My paternal grandfather had a very successful business when he was younger, but somehow that all dissolved and he ended up completely broke with nothing to leave to his family, dementia, and a mindset that his children should take care of him (which they did, until his death last year.) My aunt put herself through unspeakable stress and pain to take care of my grandfather, who was completely ungrateful for it. 

Most of my dad’s family has ended up in a mental hospital by 70, and they’re all completely depressed or mentally ill, and I feel the same demons taking me under every day. I’ve felt dark forces around me since I can remember. I’ve seen my demons during nightmares and sleep paralysis. I think my abusive ex-boyfriend was influenced by the demons that follow me around. 

I can’t see anything good happening in my life long term. I fear I’m going to end up like everyone on my dad’s side. I recently talked about a lot of this stuff with my mom and she started crying and said she’s failed me in every way, she should’ve left my dad when I was little, and she wishes she never even married him because she was a teenager and literally only knew him for a few months before they got married. That hit so hard, because it just made me feel like my whole life was never even supposed to happen. I was just part of one giant fucked up mistake made by a naive 18 year old. 

I feel like I’m a lost soul, I wasn’t meant to exist, and because of that the dark energy got ahold of me. 

I don’t want to talk to my dad anymore. Am I wrong? I am questioning everything and I really hope I don’t live that long because I don’t see anyone in that family having any glimmer of a nice life over age 55. 

No one takes me seriously when I say my childhood fucked me up so much, because I grew up with a lot of material possessions, money, and a seemingly super involved mother. When people think of bad childhoods, they think of poverty, physical abuse, druggie parents, things like that. Maybe I’m a spoiled brat. But either way I’m just not happy, I can’t remember ever, ever being happy for more than a couple days at a time.

"When you lose the will to live, you got a big fucking problem","No longer have any passion for my interests, or even any passion for life tbh. Im lonely af, feel worthless and hopeless. I dont want to kill myself though my mind tells me i do. But id much rather be happy, thrive and prosper. Its strange for sure. I'd like to say im a hard worker, im intuitive and a problem solver. There's things i aspire to do, and know im phyiscally and mentally capable of doing in one part of my mind. 

The other part that's always lurking is telling me im a worthless piece of shit and cant do anything and that even if i was successful still nobody would care so whats the point. Recently ive been losing the battle with that other part, and when my mind tries to rationalise my life situation (which isnt even that bad) and thoughts, the conclusion it comes to, is self termination. Sometimes i get too overwhelmed by it and imagine having a gun and pointing it under my chin. I pull the trigger and imagine it all going away almost instantly. It doesnt make me feel better as i do it in moments i might have legit pull the trigger in the heat of the moment. It makes the real me glad i dont have a gun (i live in uk so i cant really get one all that easily anyway).

Just want to add, most of the things that my mind perceives as major fucking problems like having no friends or girfriend can be overcome, its not a terminal illness, even if my mind wants me to see it that way. I say this to people a lot but i believe it, with a healthy mind there isnt much a human cant overcome. Look at tyson fury, he was a pork pie with the jelly around it, he was a coke addict. And by getting help with his mental health hes now heavy weight champion of the world. Then people like caroline flack (sorry if i misspelled) got herself in a pretty bad sitaution, and her mental health issues made it seem 1000x worse to her. With a healthy mind she could have gone to court and taken her punishment, and dealt with the repercussions. It would have been hard as heck and taken a toll on her for sure. But it could have been done.

Wanting to die or kill yourself is not a rational thought. Theres nothing rational at all about poor mental health. I think it has helped me a lot understanding the science a lil bit. Just the fact that these chemical imbalances can fuck us up in so many ways. Thinking about that definitely helps bring perspective.",HelloThere2818,7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe39an/when_you_lose_the_will_to_live_you_got_a_big/

"I don't have depression. but I need advice, I tried to post in so many Sub Reddits but it keeps deleting","Hey, I'm in a 14 year old female (9th grade), and right now I'm in a low point in my life ( no I am not one of those im14andthisisdeep girls haha). At the moment I really don't want to discuss everything yet, but there is this one situation I do.

ALSO please mind that I am bad at expressing myself, so this may sound repetitive.

I'll try to list everything...

My friend group consists of around 9 people (I think, it keeps adding up, and I'll explain later). There is this girl in my ""friend group"" (can't really say 'friends"" because I am not really close to them) who keeps avoiding me. She started to avoid me around the start of the school year. She started show her dislike around me when my friends were talking jokingly, (I can't recall properly, sorry) that if they were not going to receive any flowers in Valentines Day, hence saying some people in my friend group do, they would group up and watch a movie together. I was curious, so I asked something related to it (sorry, can't remember exactly :(, I think I said something like ""Oh! What movie?"" or ""When?"" (like when would this event take place) ). She then rudely replies with ""Who are YOU!?"". This other girl from my friend group just stared at me (Not in a rude way, but in a way I can't read her expression) I was kind of hurt then.

This behaviour kept continuing. Around a few days later, I went to the spot where my friends sat, and sat next to the girl who apparently dislikes me. She IMMEDIATELY stood up and rushed (no kidding, she ran away from me) to the opposite side, and sat there. I just blankly stared at her, again hurt the frick for me. The group stayed silent, then same girl who looked at me then said ""Oh, I know why"".

Because of this, I was in a shit mood. The shittiest mood I've been compared to the whole day. I was walking to my HSIE class (where 2 of my other ""friends"" were in). I asked one of them, (for her privacy, I'll call her ""Sally"") why (let's call her Fiona) keeps avoiding me. Sally replies saying I said something to Fiona *A FEW MONTHS AGO* that pissed her off. Sally then tells me to not worry, and that Fiona is a *""petty person""* . (Honestly, I thought okay, wtf? I actually was actually tearing up a bit due to sadness, not to the extent of crying though)

Timeskip to a few days, (with Fiona going to the opposite side of the friend circle *As AlWaYs!1!,* and with me now, I try no to be near her, but even being the slight nearest, she goes even further away). I asked someone who was friends/close to Fiona while going out of my commerce class to the next period. I explained the situation to her (*whilst clinging to the edge of the wall like that Yandere girl from Yandere simulator because I am awkward af, seriously*). She also responds to something similar. She said Fiano used to act up like that to her and I just need to get used to it. (I was tearing up AgAin (not to the extend to cry) \*le fucking sigh\*). She then adds ""Oh, you don't like it?"". She then says something similar that Sally said before ""She is just petty"" (ugh so tired of hearing that word from everyone).

Timeskip\~\~

She keeps avoiding me, not sitting next to me. Recently I was going to the bathroom with another girl, whilst walking back to class, Fiona responds ""Hey -name-"" and ignores me (wow, how nice...). When I talk, she glares at me. And more, more, MORE negative reactions to me.

Today, I had HSIE class after lunch. I was 'complaining' (not in an annoying way) about how boring it was. And then fucking Piano responds with ""Maybe if you had friends"".

I pause, literally a flash of emotions hit me: hurtfulness, pain, frustration, anger, you name it. I had just enough with her play and said something around (maybe I should of responded differently, more direct? and not nicely?) ""Why do you hate me, whatever you did, just tell me, I will say sorry"" and blah blah blah. (Sorry, I only started to notice I was too kind this year, and that it lead to me being hurt, and people taking the advantage to go on top of me (yeah, there are a few girls, again? why would you hate me?, who dislike me. I won't talk about it because this thread would be WAYYY too long) ).

Fiona then replies with ""Nothing/No you did nothing wrong. \*I just hate you."" .\*I was spreading in a bad mood. Bad morning, had a maths test, didn't sleep because I was staying up studying and also extremely VERY stressed!

The group went silent, stopped talking. I had enough, I don't want to be apart of the group (explain later). I don't want to be near HER. I. fucking.had.enough. I abruptly left the group (sorry, should've mentioned earlier, but I do that more and more often when she does something shitty to me) and walked around, staring at happy (I mean I don't really know) people with their friends, fake smiling.(ugh for some reason I approached some closely just to stare at them.

Ugh fucking amazing life.

Also I will talk about my friends now.

They weren't a fixed group, especially around 8th grade. You know when there is a new student, and the teacher would just ~~force~~ put them in your group? Well, welcome to mine!

Anyways, my group is basically where new people come. There has been 1 from 8th grade (never met her before) and an old friend who came back(left). There would be another girl who would hang out in my group and another one (that one more now). This year, 9th grade, already on our 6th week, 2 girls were introduced (I don't even remember their names).

There are certain things that creates a friend group. For example, if you like books, you stay with bookworms (the ""bookworm group""). Because of this (tho, nothing like that made me feel close to my friends), my friends group isn't so closely connected to one another. Like lunch is so fucking boring now. When was the last time I had fun during recess or lunch?(Note\_ 4 out of 5 days I have school meetings on lunch, just SRC things!) Now people just eat due to boredom, and half of them go on their phones. No (little) interactions created. I am quiet, but not the most quiet in the group, now I am. When they talk, they laugh, I don't.

But seriously, I never felt close to my friends, they would go to parties, parks, movies with each other, where am I? at home. They had photos posted on instagram one time of them in a party. They tagged each other, not including ME (only one, thanks. Btw not close to her though). They printed photo cards of those pictures and shared them to each other as memory (some are on their phone case). One picture was the korean hand heart (that saranghaeyo thingy) they made together as a circle. (Wow, like that didn't;t hurt)

Im not close to them, I feel lonely being around them, and I have no one to talk to, no one to trust. Where do I go now? How do I make friends? Because of this, I've reached out bout my loneliness online (in a few different platforms) to talk to. It's nicer to talk to someone online though.. They don't know me and keep this secret...

Sorry, this was longer than I thought. There is more I want to talk about (I never thought something that I thought was small would end up being this long). I may post some more in the future.

If there is something you want me to elaborate on, please feel free to ask! (But I won't respond if it is too personal hehe). I need someone to talk to...",cheesiemilk,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/febpwr/i_dont_have_depression_but_i_need_advice_i_tried/

I think this is my final straw and I am scared,"Warning: this is VERY long. I'm not sure what the purpose of it really is but just wanting to put this out there in the world. Maybe I'll get some advice, maybe someone will read it and realize they are not alone.

I’ve started writing this so many times and lost motivation half way through. This is yet another attempt, let’s see what happens.

I’m a 30 year old woman, I work as a photographer for a fashion company with a degree in Graphic Design, volunteer at a cat rescue 2 days a week, and suffer from depression and social/general anxiety disorder.

I first realized my teen angst wasn’t just a “phase” sometime in my early 20’s. As a teenager I would do the normal things: drink, do drugs, smoke weed. I would also write a lot but this writing, in hindsight, was some of the deepest cries for help. I’ve since lost that precious notebook, but I did come upon snippets of that “poetry” in my other sketchbooks. The stuff wasn’t anything out of the ordinary - I grew up listening to emo and other such heart wrenching music - and the style was really just lyrics trying to artistically describe the dark cloud that was inside of me every minute of every day. I lost interest in that activity around the age of 20.

I was always a shy person. I played with friends during school, but I was never allowed to have anyone over or go to anyone’s house. As a result, I was always found by myself in the yard skipping rope alone. My parents brought me to Canada when I was 9 years old in order to expand my options for education. I was born in Russia where there wasn’t much choice at the time to do anything with your life other than engineering, medicine or teaching. In that aspect, I thank them. I was able to attend an art school in Toronto and attain my Graphic Design degree which my anxious artistic brain appreciates.

When I arrived in Canada I didn’t speak much English and was in an ESL program. In that first year, 4th grade, I was bullied for not speaking the language. Some girls quickly realized that it would be fun to put rocks (the little pebbles from the playground) down my pants while we had “carpet time” (when all the kids gather around crossed legged on the floor in front of the teacher during a lesson.) They knew I wouldn’t say anything, partly because I couldn’t physically, partly because I couldn’t mentally. Kids would kick my chair constantly as they walked by, someone even throw things at me from the back. I brushed it off, went on with it. I did have two great friends (one of which is still in my life albeit we aren’t close.)

This childish bullying subsided after the first year. I went off to another school in grade 5 after moving buildings with my parents. 6th grade was split. It was yet another school (moving from elementary to middle school) and then half way through 6th grade, after establishing quite a solid group of new friends, I was transferred to a new school after yet another move by my parents. I had to start over with the friend thing and luckily I befriended a girl right away. She was also an outcast, being extremely tiny and skinny for her age and also didn’t fit in with the “cool popular kids.” Here I was laughed and looked down upon for being new, having 1 friend, and being so extremely shy. After a while I became close with another girl, let’s call her Jessica. 7th grade went by bearably with her around, outside minor incidents like having the basketball thrown at my head during recess. I was also developing extremely bad acne, so I was doomed to be the ugly shy girl for the next few years.

Ending of 8th grade is where the real trouble started with Jessica. She had an “in” with the cooler kids in the grade and being so attached to her, I got to hang out with the group occasionally. This is where we started “relationships” with two boys. She was with lets call him Andrew and I was with let’s call him Mike. We would hang out after school a lot and one day I brought them all over to my house. Mike took me down to my parent’s cellar at one point and where I thought I would have my first kiss, my hands were forced down onto his penis. I didn’t know how to retaliate so I went with it. Instead of a first kiss, I gave my first hand job. The next time we hung out was at the movies. I was brought to the bathroom for what I thought was a make out session but turned out to be an attempt at a blow job. I can’t remember whether I went through with it, I just remember crying that evening. I soon found out that Andrew and Mike had a bet going of who would get their dick sucked first and Jessica agreed to bring me into the group so they could use me for that bet. These things bled into high school. The rumours started that I was a slut and were reinforced with photos being distributed throughout the school. The photos were of me wearing see through mesh pants in provocative poses that Jessica took of me in her room one night when we were having a fun “fashion” night. She wore them too, although somehow the photos of her never got distributed. 

Finally a new girl came to the school lets call her Beth and finally things seemed to calm down. We had a great friendship going and were inseparable during high school (to the point where people were calling us lesbians.) I even attended her wedding two years ago, she’s a beautiful human being. I tried my best to have a normal life. I threw myself into art. I would come to school at 7 in the morning so spend time in the photography dark room lab. I got great marks in my classes and my teachers loved me. Of course throughout this time I did the regular teenage girl stuff. I liked boys, I would make out with them. I was already well trained in the hand job department so guys learned to hand me over to their friends once they were done with me. I just did it. It made them happy. And in my mind, that made me good at it. Why not do the thing that I felt I excelled at? Of course none of that behaviour helped the growing rumours. 

I first tried drugs in 10th grade. Beth and I would skip school, pop ecstasy, spend the day together. This went on for about a year in the 11th grade where my marks drastically plummeted. I’m not sure what the triggering factor for me to stop was, but I managed to graduate high school on the honour roll. At the end of 12th grade I met lets call him Sam. We dated for 2 years, I lost my virginity to him, but I will always remember doubting his intentions. Did he stay with me for the sex? Did he only want me around because I would smoke weed with him? It didn’t matter. I lost romantic interest in him after a year but stayed together despite us fighting because it was comfortable and a habit I just didn’t want to, or couldn’t break.

I got into my top school of choice and spent the first year working hard. After my break up with Sam, I met lets call him Dale. It was interesting at first. He would show up at my work almost daily and chat and finally we started going on real dates. He brought me gifts and showered with me with attention. I now realize that it was borderline stalker behaviour. He wouldn’t take no for an answer even if I didn’t really feel like doing anything. The thing with Dale is kind of an on and off ordeal. We were never fully together but would hang out often usually drinking or going on drives. I was starting to get really put off by him, but one night he insisted on hanging out. As you well know by now, I have trouble saying no. So we went to the bar, got a buzz going and then went driving. (I know how shameful it is to drink and I drive. I know first hand because I almost killed my friend during a drunk driving episode. I haven’t done it since and will never do it again.) We were in the car and I was completely insistent that this was a non sexual meet up. But he wouldn’t stop trying to kiss me, to push my hands on to his crotch, then pushing my head down, asking me to just suck it a little. I did it just to make him shut up so I could go home. I haven’t seem him since them. I refused to talk to him and eventually had to block him. To this day he tries to make attempts at communication but nothing dangerous. 

The truly destructive behaviour started around 22 when I began to frequent parties. At first it was drinking, and a lot of it. Then I met a 28 year old man lets call him Izack. He was a DJ and very much into the rave party scene. It was with him when I tried coke for the first time at the age of 23 or 24. Lets just call the rest a blur. I would party twice a week, heavily on drugs, go to school completely hung over. Long story short, I just managed to graduate, scraping by with a warning letter and passing marks given to me probably only out of the kindness of my professor’s heart. I loved Izack. He was older, had more experience, best sex I’ve ever had and he made me forget everything and everyone. He lived downtown in an apartment with two other roommates who also loved to party and we all got along quite well. The sanctuary of that apartment was heavenly. I would be able to spend all my time there away from my strict Russian parents. Then Izack started going on the road a lot more due to his DJ career flourishing. When he was away, I would come to his place and clean everything. I bought him a huge new TV for his room. I wanted him to come home to a beautiful place. In my mind that was me saying thank you for letting me stay with him rent free for so many days of the week. 

About a year into our relationship, I went for a gynaecologist check up which was followed by a phone call saying that I have an STD. They told me to get myself and my partner into the office so we could be given medication. It was nothing overly serious, cleared up with a few pills but I had to have a serious conversation with Izack. He swore on his life that he never cheated on me. He begged me to believe him which after hours upon hours of me crying and pleading, I finally did. But I never got over the nagging feeling that something wasn’t right. So after a month of uncertainty, over the phone on my birthday (I remember that day so clearly), I asked him one more time. I’m not sure what made him tell me truth this time around, but yes, of course he slept with someone on tour and yes that is how I contracted the STD.

I was a complete and utter wreck for the next few months. The drugs and alcohol increased. I went on Tinder and began my first sex binge. At one point I managed to sleep with 6 different men in one week. All I wanted to do was to forget the hurt and I didn’t know how. Again, all of this is very blurry so I can’t say the exact moment that Izack came back into my life but he did. I remember going to a bar to meet him to get closure, to finally say I forgive him and that I’m moving on. That meeting ended up with me in his apartment and sex. We then got “back together”, continued the destructive behaviour until his next tour where he slept with someone again. I let that one go easily since we never stated that we were officially a couple again. I think this is where I learned how to numb my brain from hurt. I wasn’t mad at him anymore, I just quietly walked away and threw myself into my second huge sex binge on Tinder. After a few months of this, I met a guy lets call him Jon. 

We dated for something close to a year. This relationship was also fuelled by alcohol, drugs and parties. But at this point I didn’t want another life. The relationship involved me crying almost every day at work with something abusive he may have said to me that day. For example, he loved to make me feel like an idiot for asking him why it took him hours to answer a text massage. I was told I was crazy on an almost daily basis. I will fast forward to the end, where a girl (who is now a friend) reached out to me saying that she was also dating Jon, for 6 months now. She spotted us at a party kissing, and lost her mind. Apparently she had no knowledge of me for the long while they were together. It turns out, that we weren’t the only ones. I came to the knowledge that he had slept with 8 different people during the span of being with me. This included his upstairs neighbour who I was constantly told not to worry about. 

I laughed at this. I didn’t cry, I didn’t feel angry, I laughed, pulled out my phone and on to the next Tinder binge I went.

It took me about 6 months to get into my next relationship. This one was with a kind man who would never do a thing to hurt me. It lasted for about 2 years. I met his parents and he met mine. We were talking about marriage and moving in together but it ended up falling apart during our search for an apartment. We just weren’t right for each other.

So this is where I am now. 30 years old, living back with my parents. I have since stopped the partying because that life doesn’t satisfy me anymore and my body can’t handle it. I have been coke free for about a year now mainly because I can’t afford it. But I drink. I drink several times a week because I can’t stand my job. I drink because I feel trapped in my own mind. I drink because of my living situation. I drink because nothing I do excites me. I drink about 3 times a week and once I crack a bottle of wine, there is no way I can stop. That bottle is getting drunk to the last drop and more often than not, a second one gets opened and lasts about half way until I pass out. 

The job thing - realized I’m the only one who can help myself there so I have been taking lots of photos and editing them in an effort to update my portfolio but sitting down and editing those photos sober just isn’t an option. I go to work, I laugh with my coworkers, but at the end of the day, the only thing that makes me happy and that I took forward to is that next drink. I started exercising and have been continuing to do so pretty consistently but I always fall off the boat because I can’t stay excited and motivated. 

Last night I came home to my collection of wine bottles all out and displayed in front of me by my dad. My mom discovered the first bottle in my closet when she couldn’t find my cat, or so she says. She then proceeded to go through every crevice of my room and pulled out the 20 or so I had hidden. Long story short, my life of drinking after work and during my own photo editing hours is over and I am terrified. I feel like I have nothing happy to come home to. I spent all last night crying and today is the first day I didn’t show up to work because of this. The thing is - I don’t know if I want to stop. I’ve had thoughts of suicide since my early teenage years and they have never gone away. I’ve cut myself on numerous occasions. I have dabbled with the idea of overdosing on my anxiety and depression medication. I did go into therapy for a few months but that turned out way too pricey for my minimal salary. My dad has offered to pay for my therapy last night, but this is an offer I’m not sure I want to take. I just want it to be over. The only times things are okay in my brain is when I am sleeping, or when I am heavily buzzed. I don’t have children, nor a boyfriend and I have maybe 2 friends, so I’m finding it difficult to see a purpose to go on. 

I would like to finish by saying how awful I feel about putting this out there. The amount of times the word “I” is used is upsetting and selfish since I know there are people out there who have it way worse than me. Like my parents have pointed out numerous times, I have nothing to be sad about. I have a good job, a warm house, food and water. I have a car that my dad so kindly gave to me when he bought himself a new one. And they are right. I have it so good. But inside, that dark cloud just won’t lift and there is no way I can describe it in words to someone who hasn’t felt the pull of it.

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart to anyone who read this fully, attempted to read it, or even glanced at it. I am very scared and for some reason the only thing I thought of this morning was writing this.",Throwawayuser68534,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fefuh9/i_think_this_is_my_final_straw_and_i_am_scared/

I think I need to leave my partner of 10 years,"My Girlfriend and I have been together for ten years and I don't know what to do anymore. She suffers from depression, anxiety and severe OCD.

Over the last couple of years here anxiety has worsened and over the last few months it's just too much for me, we don't see anybody anymore, if we do she has a panic attack before it and i've ended up having to cancel plans. It's our nieces third birthday party tomorrow and we were supposed to be going to stay up at my parents for the weekend and she doesn't want go. Fair enough, but I have been seeing my family less and less because of her needing her weekends to herself.

She's not from here so has no family or friends here who aren't mine so she really feels like she has nobody else but I'm exhausted. I can ask her family and friends from back home to talk to her but she doesn't want me to tell anyone. She believes she is just in the way and makes everyone's life shit, I try and tell her it's not true but it's so deep rooted into her mind that she just think she'd be better off dead, she's threatened suicide before so I feel like if I leave her even for this weekend she would kill herself as it's not really a threat but just her mindset of thinking she's better off dead. Idk anymore, I really don't. I don't even know if this is just kme being an asshole i'm just lost and confused and tired. I still love her but she just doesn't care about life anymore.

She stopped taking medication about a year ago as she thought it was making it worse, I respected her wishes and tbh, sometimes it seemed fine but lately it's absolutely not fine and she refuses to go back on any form of medication.

I lost my youth to school,"I know that a lot of people say that they lost their younger years to anxiety and depression. There is no doubt that I've definitely lost a lot of years to those same things, but I feel like a large portion of my life has been wasted in school. 

Of course there is a lot of useful things schools teaches that can be applied in every day life, but school has become the worst part of my day, which is especially troubling since it takes up such a large part of it. And after school, I'm just so drained and it makes me so sad to be alive. 

You'll probably have it in most school systems regardless of country, but American school are just such a shitty environment for people who have mental issues. How am I even supposed to properly deal with these issues when I'm constantly bombarded with all this schoolwork? How am I supposed to experience life and enjoy it when I'm trapped in an environment that worsens my mental health and anxiety? 

It's my last year of high school, but I still can't help but feel like I would be happier having dropped out. Realistically, the long term would look worse, but school environments are so toxic a lot of the time. The pressure to conform is just so strong and I don't know how other people feel, but it almost makes me hate being different, it makes me want to be ""normal""

I'm just venting a little. I don't know if this would really make sense to other people, tbh I'm kinda fucked up mentally right now cause school is a bitch. Thx for reading :)",JohnJohnson369369,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe9fy7/i_lost_my_youth_to_school/
Today was actually a good day.,"Hello everyone! I, as well as most people on the subreddit, have depression. I've been struggling with it for a few years. Recently I was prescribed with welbutrin. I must say that I cant express how much better I've been doing. I still have my moments at night but it's definitely not as bad. I've been struggling with my weight for a while as well but I was just laying in bed and had a weird switch get flipped and now I want to change my diet, i want to start going to the gym and be active. It's crazy because I'm lazy as fuck. Maybe doing this will help a lot with my depression. 

I'm scared though because a few years ago I broke my back while playing football. I was really active outdoors. I played football for the school, I kayaked, hiked, etc. Not being able to do those things has caused me to gain a bunch if weight and become insanely depressed. I lost feeling in my toes for 6 months after the initial accident. I wasn't able to do anything active. My toes are fine now but the fact that I'm not able to do what I used to do because of the accident has caused me to be depressed. I dont want to be depressed anymore, I'm sure everyone can relate. I want to get my life back the way it was and the only way I can do it is to step out of my comfort zone and find someone who will be willing to help me achieve my goal. 

Although it may be difficult, I know if I try my hardest I can achieve my goal. I apologize for the rant but this sudden change in my mindset has got me really motivated and honestly a bit emotional. I was scared I'd never find a way out of this rut. I'm also scared to lose this motivation. I dont want this to be a small fluke of motivation and then tomorrow I'm right back at where I was. But I shouldn't focus on tomorrow.

I’m starting to feel like I’m not meant for this world anymore,"I’m 17, and I’ve been feeling this way ever since I was 15. I have no friends, social anxiety and I’ve been homeschooled since I was 5. And to top it all off, I have asperger’s syndrome. I’d give away everything I have just to have at least one real friend who understands me and just to be normal.

My anxiety has gotten so bad that I can barely even go out anymore. I for some reason have a huge fear of kids around my age. I almost had a panic attack just for checking out my new college with my mum. I don’t think I’ll ever make it there. I like a lot of stuff that I’m sure no one my age likes and I get angry at my relatives for no reason. 

I hate being a teen. Why do hormones exist? Why is everything so complicated? Why am I losing my mind? I never used to have to worry about any of this shit as a little kid. I wish I could go back in time and undo whatever the fuck it was that made me this way. I come from a good family, so it’s not family related. Only thing I do is isolate myself from the entire world + my family by just staying in my room playing games and watching videos. I can’t do anything else.

The only thing keeping me alive is my family. I cry or feel like crying whenever I picture them looking in horror at me taking my life.",depressedthrowwway02,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fecjnj/im_starting_to_feel_like_im_not_meant_for_this/

Depression from Chronic Iniury,"Hi all, I’ve dealt with mild depression most of my life and handle it decently through medication, on and off therapy and CBT.  

However I’ve had 3 failed shoulder surgeries since 2016 and my shoulder pain triggers relapses into anger, depression, and feeling bad for myself.   I can’t play basketball anymore which I loved, I have trouble holding and playing with my two young daughters as well.  When I try something that I can no longer do (our daughter on my shoulders or shoot hoops in the driveway) it usually means I will be down for the rest of the day. 

I know people deal with much more serious strokes of misfortune than a bad arm but I often spiral into feeling bad for myself and being mad at myself for the basketball plays that led to the original injuries.  

Does anyone recommend a book, a method of CBT or any advice for me to deal with this better?

Am I faking my feelings?,"I've seen people question this before, but never identified with it enough to pay attention until now. So, here is the post.

I will frame unnecessary explanations with ""//"", in case anyone reading wants to skip. Although I'd like to warn you that this post is somewhat long regardless, as I like to explain things.

I've been considering myself unworthy (of a real friend, of feeling better, of complaining) since a long time, as I have a nice life, or because that I'm not feeling as bad as many other people who are said to be depressed. I obviously never wanted to be sad, nor to experience bad things, but I wanted to be worthy of some certain things I felt I needed. Over time I began feeling worse and worse, to a point where I compare myself more than I used to do, where almost everything upsets me. 

//For example, let's say there is a character I relate to and am happy about being alike. That used to be a source of motivation. Now when I see this character, I can only think of how much better this said persona is compared to myself, and how I can never be like them. When I look at something I value, rather than being happy I feel worried of what might happen to them. Or, when entering a new season I mourn the previous, alongside all the time I wasted.//

I'm mostly worried, stressed, or sad. The thing is that there is no clear reason for me to feel so. I sometimes question if I myself feel that way..



I also am having a hard time figuring my feelings for over a year. There are some occasions where I thought I didn't feel anything, but couldn't help crying.

The reason I'm writing this post is that, while watching a show, a character explained a 'negative' habit of the other, which I ultimately related to. It's not something I consider to be really bad. However, after that scene I couldn't somehow focus to the episode. My interest faded to a point. It was almost as if I was reacting to what was said, but I don't even care that much. The character cared, but not me. Was I impersonating his emotions? Or am I just faking all these to feel worthy? I cannot understand this. Am I really sad or am I just kidding myself?

I can barely read my own feelings, beliefs, and thoughts at this point. Like, I still know what they are, but I can't feel that. Not always, but mostly it's like a colourless, pitcureless page of information. ""I feel this, I think that."" but, do I really?

Hating what I used to love,"I don't know if this is the right place to post about this, but I thought I would give it a shot.

I've been an artist my whole life, ever since I can remember. I went through many years of art school, and while studying I was doing well. Art has been synonymous with my identity forever, and I've always wanted to be an artist more than anything else.

But I've also had mental health issues my entire life, and I've gone through a couple of periods of terrible depression in the past. I've been medicated since I was a child, so that's helped most of the time. But now, starting last autumn, I've gone into a depressive period that's a bit different than the previous ones. 

I think a combination of my medication losing efficacy and experiencing an artistic burnout are the reasons for this depression. I did two solo shows recently and have been pushing myself to draw so much, so I think burnout is very likely. In any case, I started to notice that I didn't enjoy drawing anymore.

Drawing became a terrible, dreaded chore. It started to feel like way too much work - and that work was not interesting or exciting. The work was also difficult and just SO much. SO many lines. Honestly, when I think about drawing I start to feel physically unwell. 

I've been advised to take a break from drawing, and I'm doing so. I haven't actually drawn anything for about a couple of weeks, and I'm going for one month. 

I'm just so terrified that I'll never enjoy drawing again. I can't even remember what it feels like to not hate drawing. But I still want to be an artist so much. Plus, I honestly don't have any other hobbies unrelated to art that I could focus on. Nothing else really interests me.

I should also mention that I'm switching medications right now, and I'm about to go onto a full dose of my new medication (which is actually one that's worked for me in the past).  

I've never experienced anything like this, and I'm so scared. Any thoughts or advice would be super appreciated.",lindanimated,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/feca1a/hating_what_i_used_to_love/

I'm not supposed to be alive right now and yet, here I am. And it's all because they decided not to go. If I had chosen not to, been moments away and stopped because I'm a coward, that would have been fine. But no. I don't even get to blame myself for it.

Questions regarding therapy,"So I just talked to my parents today for the first time regarding that I want to get therapy. I just have a few questions (they may be hard to answer, so bare with me, I just want to know what to expect): 

1) idk if this makes sense, but some of my typical depressive thoughts seem to not be as accessible when i'm in a better (not happy though) mood. this makes it harder to talk about the underlying issues. could this be a potential problem?

2) what do they typically ask you on the first appointment?

3) if i've been really narrow-minded and close-minded to a lot of people around me trying to tell me to think more positive and eat more, etc., is therapy really best for me? would therapy be helping me become less stubborn and more open-minded?

4) for those who have gone through therapy, was it relieving to finally have the official diagnosis?

5) again, for those who have gone through/are going through therapy, what's the biggest change you've seen in yourself? it can be good or bad.

On my mind,"So after ages I finally asked my Crush (and one of my best friends) out on a date. And she said yes.This made me the fking happiest i've bin in forever. After 2 months of dating I realized that we were taking it very slowly. I thought it was fine, good things need their time to blossom.   
After another 2 months I realized that i was suffering under these circumstances and that it was really hard for me not knowing if she still liked me back. Yes we kissed and yes she initiated it once but two weeks ago this happened:

After one of the best nights i ever had, we were talking in the car and I just asked if everything was alright with ""us"". After a moment of silence I dreaded her answer and then she startet trying to say something. She tried and tried again and again until she finally said: "" I am in love with someone else... And the thing is it's not another male.""This has been really hard on me. I don't think she's a Lesbian but i, felt how insecure she was about her own sexuallity and that she was sooo afraid that people would not accept her anymore. Now i am stuck in a wierd af situation. I still really love her and I feel like giving up on ""us"" isn't even an option. She has been one of my best friend in ages and I dont want to loose her. But i dont know if its healthy for me if we keep on seeing each other or hanging out. I mean i've been kinda depressed for a while now, the bad feelings and thought come and go.

I'm also worried that if I distance myself from her that it would intensify her insecurites.

If she were in love with another guy i'd probalby stop seeing her tho, wouldn't I? Or at least I should, shouldn't I?

I told her that we have to talk and we are going to meet on Sunday. I just dont know what i want to tell her. That I love her? That we are done? That we are cool and that she should sort her stuff out?That she's a bitch for dating me for months with no intention of being in a relationship? I have pretty bad moodswings and don't know what I really feel.  
I just know that things can't stay the same as they are now.

My Depression,"  

The thoughts of a 30-year-old depressed guy. I am afraid of, well not afraid but the things I think about on a regular basis. I worry if my daughter will be taken away from because of my crazy ex-wife. I worry about what my daughter thinks or will think of me because I have no goals or ambitions right now other than to make enough money to outshine my ex-wife. I want to do all these things, but I am too worried about everything that will go wrong with them. I want to start a business and be successful, but I am afraid of failure and getting stuck right back where I am, which is like resetting my whole life. I worry about if I am going to get cancer because I am addicted to chewing tobacco and want to stop for my daughters sake because I don’t want it to influence her life because I have been told it is bad for you. I worry about being alone the rest of my life because I can’t seem to find anyone who loves me or is it because I am to shallow and don’t think anyone over 150 lbs. is pretty. I can’t sleep because my mind races and races at night and these things flow through my mind. I worry about looking successful to the people around me which holds me back because I don’t want to show how unsuccessful I am right now. I feel like a failure and a worthless person. the only thing that gets me through the really really tough thoughts is my daughter. And if I wasn’t here who would raise her. The pressure around me to do the right thing is tremendous but what is the right thing? Is the right thing what everyone thinks or what is socially acceptable? Is the right thing what I think is right? but then why do other people think some of the things I do are wrong? What makes them right? I think about the things in my past that I could have done differently but what’s the point? I can’t change them so why do I dwell on them? Do I need to even worry about them? I worry about how I am going to pay for things if I lose my VA disability but I don’t want to go to my VA appointments because I feel it reinforces the fact that I am messed up and I come up with excuses as to why I shouldn’t go. to try to reason with myself as to why its ok not to go. It’s also a distance away which wastes 2 hours of my days sitting at home doing nothing. So is it helpful to go to an appointment and lie to a doc for 15 mins telling him that every things ok and I take meds, Which I don’t take my meds because 1 I hate taking medication every day and 2 I don’t like to think taking them helps but they do because if I took them then I might not be writing this. I know I need to do better but I work at a dead-end job that has no future for me. I am just a pawn in someone else’s business story. I want to make more money, but I don’t know where to go because no one is telling me where to go and I am afraid to start anything just to fail. I don’t want to waste my time doing something and have that time taken from me by an unforeseen event. But why do I worry about an unforeseen event when I can’t even see it coming. Is my life that messed up that I am worried about something that may or may not happen. I sit here typing this looking into my baby monitor telling myself I need to do better for my daughter. What example am I setting for her if I don’t do anything with my life. I thought I had my whole life planned out then boom my world is rocked by an unhealthy relationship which everyone but me saw. Everyone told me I shouldn’t have been with that girl. Everyone told me I needed to leave her. But as cliché (why did I just look up how to spell cliché in something I am only going to read) as it sounds, I loved her. Or at least what I thought was love. I was ready to spend my life with her, but she went and fucked two other people and who knows how many others. But blamed me because she thought I had an affair…. Which I didn’t have an affair. I write this hoping my feelings will leave my body and I will not worry about them anymore. But for how long is it going to last? Is this really going to help? Maybe I’ll post this on some reddit website and become famous for it. Ha who am I kidding. I am nobody. I am a middle age man who has been handed a fucked-up life and can’t get out. But it’s not as fucked up as some people’s lives so why does mine hurt so bad? Maybe I am stuck on the materialistic things and want to hide behind them. Like having a nice truck but not as nice as the one I want because I am smart enough not to burry myself in debt and have that looming over me. I am content on doing nothing but am afraid of everything. I tell myself I am meant for more, but I don’t know how to get there. I am smart but not smart enough to figure out how to make myself happy. So, am I really that smart? I can tell you all night and day that I am smarter than what I am doing right now but have nothing to show for it. I think everyone is out to get me in some way shape or form, I don’t trust anyone, I think they all have some agenda to serve themselves but don’t we all. Is anyone truly selfless? Now I am just rambling to ramble so focus, focus on why I am writing this. Focus focus focus why why am I handed a dealt of cards that has no instructions? is that life? What’s the purpose? Why do I even waste my time? Why can’t I win the lottery and hide behind the money at least I will be able to do the things that make me happy because I won’t be constrained by money? But if I did have it would I really be HAPPY? I think it would be better than where I am. But why would I be so lucky as to win the lottery when there are stronger people out there who deserve it more than me? is luck a figment of our imaginations? are all the strings being pulled by some divine or supreme power? Some might say I am on drugs right now to think like this. I’m not. This is how my mind works and I think it’s a blessing and a curse. Who will even read this? Now it’s just becoming to long for the quick reader to think it’s interesting and too short for anyone to take it seriously but I’m not writing it for them I am writing it for myself. I want to get better I want to do better. But where are the answers? Do I make up the answers and hope I get by? Do I tell lies and belittle other people to get through life? Why not? It feels like other people, all people do it to me. Who is coming to punish those who do me wrong? Do I do it? No, why? because I am afraid of the consequences. I am pressured by everyone to do the right thing. Maybe that’s what governs people? Then why doesn’t everyone act the same? Are there to many questions in this? Who cares? Its mine right, maybe I will share this so someone can laugh, someone can feel empowered to do the same? Someone can belittle me? I need to do better I need to push myself to do better. I started working out because I thought I might get laid if I look better. But is anyone even going to notice? I wasn’t in shape before and got laid, sort of… I more or less have always found the girl who is in need and made her feel better, then when that wears off, I am alone… am I going to be alone for the rest of my life? At least I have my daughter, right? But eventually she will leave me too because no one wants to be around someone as depressed as me… I wouldn’t want to be around me. I always hear this saying on the radio or tv or what have you “ you have to love yourself before anyone can love you”… who am I kidding I will always be alone because I don’t see myself loving myself. I am fat, ugly and stupid. I don’t have any value. I don’t have the ability to love anyone else because I just want to use the other person to make myself feel better. But how is that? Does that even make sense? Am I connecting with anyone? If this is circulating around and you are reading this far, then possibly? Should I keep going? Maybe I still feel like going. My fingers are starting to hurt but it feels a little better to not have all these things bottled up inside me. Maybe it’s because I am pretending to type it to an imaginary audience. so, things I worry about. I worry about paying bills, but I am good at financial stuff. So that’s ok but I still worry about them. I worry that I am not doing the right thing. I worry about what other people think of me but that’s ridiculous. I should not worry about that right? I worry about the spelling in this, but I have spell check. I worry about sleeping all day when I have my daughter because she could hurt herself because she is 2. I also worry she is going to grow up and think I just slept all the time, but she doesn’t know I was up until 3am writing a stupid paper about the things I worry about. But that’s not her fault. I worry about making a good impression on the people around me because I don’t want to be alone and the only people around me is family right now. I seem to piss everyone else off. Why do I piss them off? Because I am pushing people away so they can’t hurt me. Is that an excuse? I worry about getting into an accident and not being able to take care of my responsibilities, but should I? I worry about being someone else’s burden, I don’t want to hinder someone else’s life with my inability to love myself. It is no one’s problem but my own. But there are people who want to help me or are they getting paid to do so because someone decided it was good for business to make money on others suffering. #cancer maybe that’s too much. I definitely can’t post this anywhere now. I worry about getting up in the morning and it being my last day. I worry that all of this will pile up and I’ll do something I can’t take back. But that’s why I think of my daughter, I worry I’ll be trapped in this life and these circumstances for a long time because I am too afraid to take a leap of faith and just try to make my life better. I worry about anything and everything. I don’t care about anyone other than my daughter truly, her life is the only real thing I care about. She is so innocent, am I contaminating her life by being in it though? Is my negative thinking rubbing off on her and will she be like me? I hope not. I see the negative in everything. I can’t think fast but when I do think at my own pace, I can figure shit out. I worry about being in a situation I can’t think my way out of. I truly worry about everything. My daughter is being pushed into school. Well I think so. Her mother doesn’t want her to not be in school, because she is ready. I think it’s because her mom doesn’t want to take care of her and wants to push her into school so someone else must deal with her. She seems too young to start preschool in my mind. Why do I care so much about what my ex-wife is doing or thinks? Maybe it is because I have to deal with her for the rest of my life, not like she is going away and I can’t not talk to her because then the court will see me as being unfit to parent then I will lose my daughter. I don’t want that now do I. I feel like my ex-wife has her life together and mine is falling apart underneath me but maybe she is just hiding it like I am trying to do? But I’m the one writing this so we will stick with my feelings. I don’t want to lose my daughter but everything I do I am feeling like it is a movement on a chess board and at any moment I am going to get check mated. Who even uses a term like that anymore? Apparently, I do. I worry about who is going to care for my daughter when I am not around. I worry she will fall into something and I can’t save her. Literally and figuratively. I worry my life is pointless then I think of her smile and watch videos of her, and it makes me happy. I worry I am a burden on people, and no one wants to deal with me, so I try to hide myself. I feel I am not good at anything. Or not good enough. I feel lonesome tired afraid and beaten down. I have to many struggles. too much on my mind. Emotionless. Defeated. Unintelligent, worthless, hopeless. Who thinks like this? I do. I have depression.",user1522,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/feaqrz/my_depression/
I isolate myself when I crave interaction.,"I feel pretty down every month or so, very down. I usually feel self hate and loneliness. I desperately crave feeling loved and cared about, and I have the urge to talk to people I'm close to, but all I end up doing is isolating myself, depriving myself of what I want, and then feel worse. It pushes people away.

Does anyone else isolate themselves and bottle up what they are feeling? Anyone know why I do it?

"I’m a pos, and you’re a pos too.","Perhaps I’m just playing the victim, but life has been pretty shitty lately and I’m spinning circles in my head. Am I the problem? Are all of the situations I find myself in, woven by me? Am I the diabolical monster weaving this fucking hell I’m stuck in? I’m so fucking tired of my brain coming to the conclusion that I am the victim. I’m tired. Some how it’s your fault that I’m codependent. It’s your fault that my choice in men has always been the worst. I mean, it has to be your fault that I married at 19, to the only person stupid enough to say yes. It has to be your fault that I’m four years into a relationship I feel has no escape. I’m drowning and I have the weight of an entire second person tugging at my feet. I fucking blinked and here I am. Years older but my brain feels like it hasn’t evolved in the slightest. Still easily disturbed and hurt. Still putting all my trust into one person just to be let down. Just to come to the harsh realization that they are human too, they make mistakes too. I know, I know… Everyone fucks up, but why does it feel like the world is ending when the people that mean the most to me fall short of my unrealistic expectations? Why do I feel ridiculously deceived? Surely I am their whole entire life, surely their world revolves around me. Why do I get stuck with these insecure, unsure thoughts rolling and crashing in my head. Surely it’s your fault, of course. I mean you were supposed to be the only man that never left. You were supposed to be the one that held me when I was let down. You were supposed to show me that I deserve more than what my taste lusts for. I’m sorry you never had that either. I’m sorry no one ever showed you right from wrong and I’m sorry no one held you when your heart was broken.

I’m so exhausted and scared,"Hey guys. Last week, i went through the roughest day that ocd has ever thrown at me, which pushed me to finally tell my mom that I was going through severe anxiety (OCD) and I didn’t know what to do anymore.

I can’t walk down the street without worrying about whether or not I knocked someone over without realizing it, or bumped someone into the road without realizing it, or worrying about a rabid animal biting me without realizing it and dying from rabies, or worrying about stepping on a needle infected with HIV, or worrying about a homeless person infecting me with HIV/something worse without me realizing it.

I can’t drive without worrying about whether I hit a pedestrian without realizing it on that right turn, or that left turn, or if that green light was really green or did I just run a red light and run over a pedestrian crossing without realizing it?

I can’t get near moving water without worrying about the brain eating amoeba. If I get splashed in the face, Ill freak out internally for the rest of the day. I can’t eat food without worrying about it being poisoned or worrying about tapeworms.

I can’t have a basic conversation without worrying about whether something I say will come back to haunt me

I KNOW these things are stupid and will probably never happen, but my brain keeps on throwing me the “what if?” and I won’t be able to move on. I’ll even get physically affected by my anxiety- my eyes will burn and it will get harder to breathe

Anyway, my mom set up an appointment for a psychiatrist (I’m 18 and I’m still not smart enough/have enough money to set one up myself, I feel worthless already, pls don’t remind me) and I went there today.

The guy seemed like a good guy and everything, and made me sign paperwork as I was talking to him and everything, and everything was cool. On the way out, my mom asked the guy how much the bill would be, and he said it would be around 300 dollars for the first visit and around 150 for every visit after that.

I’ve been so upset ever since. I feel so bad. I told my mom I didn’t feel good going to a psychiatrist if it would be that expensive, but she’s super super supportive and insists on me getting help (she goes through anxiety too, to a lesser extent).

Then, my brain got the idea that what if the papers the guy made me sign was really a contract that would come back to haunt me later (ex-what if I signed away part of my future income,etc.) it sounds so stupid and it is. My brain just sees everything as a threat and is stuck in a perpetual fight or flight mode

Anyway, I don’t know what to do. I feel Iike for the past eight months I’ve just been a drain on my parents and everyone around me. All I am is a burden that can’t even make myself happy. I feel like if I don’t go to anymore appointments with this psychiatrist, I’ll have thrown away 300 bucks of my mom’s money for no reason, but if I do go to another appointment with him, I’ll cost her 150 a pop. I feel like I’m taking advantage of people and I feel like I’m too stupid to get my act together. I just want to be able to be happy again and have peace of mind. I’ve watched myself literally go nuts and I don’t know what to do anymore. To add to it, this is all in my head. I can’t even tell reality from obsession anymore. This whole battle that I’ve fought for the last eight months is all in my head. I’m not doing anything productive by fighting OCD. I’m just wasting my time and I feel like ocd is just my excuse for being worthless.

Everything makes me cry and I don't even feel like going out of my room most days. I go to a psychiatrist and I am on meds but nothing seems to be working. (Ive changed almost 7 therapists/psychiatrists now because my mental health was showing no improvement.) I feel like a parasite, latching on to my mother and aunts for financial support. I want to move out and live independently but I don't even feel anything. I don't feel like doing anything, let alone wanting to work. I constantly worry whether I'm just being lazy and making excuses or whether I genuinely have a problem. I don't want to face people, give interviews or work among other people.

The world is a big disappointment?,"Is it just me or does the world seem to be fucked ever since 2012. I wish the world ended in 2012 so I wouldn't have to deal with all the bullshit that I have been through. 

I'm currently in debt by like $25000, I work a full time job that is dependent on weather and the sea. My job pays well through winter but once summer hits I get paid fuck all. When I fall fully into a depressive/dilussional state of mind. My brain races at 100 miles an hour at all times, every little thing I over analyse. I have seen my only friend go through drug addiction and drug related psychosis. I have seen how life can shit all over you. 

My depression started at an early age because of bullying and lack of friends. Except the one in my life currently, you can't destroy our relationship. I feel like my depression really kicked in when I was around 15 or 16. My friend moved away to another city and I was left all alone. At the time bullying got worse and I made a few acquaintances but no real close friends. When I was 17 I dropped out of school and moved out of my family home. I started to have panic attacks in the shower and that was when I turned to drugs to numb the pain. Xanax was my go to for sedation as I could fight the effects somehow I loved that. Iv been a daily cannabis smoker for most of the time since I was 16 except the times I ran out and couldn't get anymore. I have done lots of psychedelics (u could call me a psychonaut) any sort of alternate reality really. Cannabis helps motivate me to stuff. 

I'm currently 19, still a virgin and struggling with financial situations. I  only just earn enough money every week to cover my bills so I never really buy anything for myself except weed. I can never seem to get ahead of my depression. It's like it just keeps dragging me down. When I'm really depressed I choose to sleep most of the day as sleeping is the only place where I can shut the fuck up. (I have lucid dreams all the time).

It comes in waves and always has done, but I'm feeling it is affecting my productivity a lot less than it used to, obviously I'm more productive when I'm not feeling like this, but by Monday I probably won't feel like this.

I used to have thoughts of ending it, still do sometimes but I'm glad I didn't. I'm much happier now that I know it's not constant.

We take our victories when we can.,"This is my own personal experiences not a how too or trying in any way to say my life is worse or the way I cope will help anyone else.

It has been a long journey, a fight every day, sometimes we win sometimes we loose.

Looking back 22 years ago, I was never formerly diagnosed with ADHD or Bipolar type 2 effective disorder, was never diagnosed officially as on the higher function autistic spectrum that all came much later.

The umbrella term seemed to be Reactive Depression relating to not only my Fathers death when I was 12 but my Girlfriend/Wife being diagnosed with incurable cancer at 21.

I spent the following 20 years fighting along side my Wife against this horrible illness that slowly destroyed her body until 20th November 2018 a double cardiac arrest with me standing next to her telling the doctors to stop because I knew she wasn't coming back. (her heart was a 14% functionality due to a silent heart attack 13 days beforehand caused by damage done via medication to keep the cancer away which also caused diabetes and kidney failure).

7 days after she died I was diagnosed with Bowel Cancer and spent that Christmas in hospital having 40% of my bowels removed (I have nodules on my lungs they are keeping an eye on).

Being in the same hospital as Paola died 6 weeks beforehand plus certain pain medication caused hallucinations and the beginning of my diagnosis of PTSD.

No family because my mum by this time was in a care home in late stages of early onset dementia.

It felt like the universe was just hitting me with punch after punch just to see how many times I could stand back up.

6 months on no one visiting so outside contact, I was on suicide watch and Samaritans help line actually called me weekly to see if I was still around, I had a plan to end my life, my logic boiling down to the following two points.

If I end my life and that is the end then I am in no more pain.

If I end my life and there is something after I am with Paola.

Had a plan, even down to writing a script that would send out emails to my Doctor and Psychologist so professionals found my body not my neighbors, my dogs had a forever home setup and I was visiting all the forums and communities saying goodbye to all the games me and Wife had played.

I was in a very dark place and the only light was an oncoming train which was either ""cancer comes back"" or ""A life without my best friend)

Everything was black and grey, nothing felt real to me and even when they told me 73% chance my bowel cancer wasn't coming back I couldn't smile and be happy.

**What changed ?**

One of the last places that I was going to visit was the game The Division, it had many good memories of us both exploring, shooting out windows, messing around, I did a walk through saying goodbye to my wife, and as I logged off an advertisement for The Division 2 came up and I thought to myself, ""lets see what mess they have made"" ""No reason to keep my money if I am going to end things"" So I bought the most expensive pack, downloaded it and logged on.

Something amazing happened, the next morning I wanted to log back on, I hadn't gamed since Paola had died, I hadn't interacted, talked or blown anything up.

A few days later I wrote a reddit post on that forum thanking the developers for saving my life.

The response was amazing and people started saying why don't you go on youtube, on twitch, why don't you talk about your experiences, mental health, cancer, diabetes, dialysis, heart disease, why don't you tell the world about how gaming helped you.

My response was ""what have I got to loose"", I watched my wife die, could anything anyone said about me making a fool of myself online ever come close to this.

I bought a mic, I bought a webcam, I did cooking videos, vlogs, streaming and those victories really helped me go from day to day.

I never missed a day at least 1 video every single day went up on youtube and twitch.

I have close to 500 followers on Youtube, close to 1000 on Twitch, others follow me on Facebook, Reddit and Mixer, I now multi stream to all 4 main places.

Am I still broken yes, I am classed as severely disabled, some days It takes me coming down stairs 3 times for me remembering to brush my teeth or do laundry.

I spend a lot of time in VR Beat Saber, SkyrimVr and others, Valve sent me a Valve index with no strings attached, after reading one of my posts (both me and Paola were involved in VR since 2016 due to her disabilities it was wonderful).

VR is an amazing tool for fighting depression, the complete immersion of being within a game be it a horror, a rhythm game (I have no rhythm), or fantasy, can help switch your mind to a world where life makes more sense.

My Senior Psychologist and 2 of my specialists have signed off on me all feeling that Gaming, VR and my Vlogging actually have given me a level of existence and a place to be.

I still suffer from depression but this is how I cope, I still need post it notes on my walls to remember changing clothes, washing and shaving.",Quebber,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fedff4/we_take_our_victories_when_we_can/
I Don’t Care About Living Anymore,"Over the past few months, my depression and social anxiety have spiraled out of control. At the end of my junior year of high school I had a really bad breakup and lost all my friends causing me to start self harming and isolating myself from everyone. Thankfully, this acquaintance I had took time out of his day to make music with me at lunch. It really meant a lot to me. He was the only friend I really had at the time. I had hung out with his friends a couple times before throughout high school, so I started playing video games with some of them. Eventually during the summer I got really close to them, and I became a part of their friend group. They really brought me out of that dark hole of depression, and I had never loved a group of friends more in my entire life. I had and still am going through extreme social anxiety, but helped me become more confident in myself and alleviated that a bunch. In the beginning of senior year I hung out with them after-school basically everyday, and it was the happiest I’d ever been. 

I don’t want to get into details but then something changed. A bunch of the group dynamics changed that made me felt inferior. I thought they thought I wasn’t as funny anymore, and was more weird and awkward. I reverted back to the state I was in with my previous girlfriend, and I started to worry incessantly that I would be abandoned by them. My mindset about the group also changed. I felt like I had to constantly meet their standards and entertain them or else they would abandon me. This has made socializing with them more of a grueling chore than a fun experience. I’ve isolated myself from them a lot, and I even feel a bit of anger towards them. 

There are these events that happen that make me feel like they think I’m weird, awkward, unfunny, and annoying, so I constantly try to change myself. I try to be less talkative, and apply a tight filter to what I say. I hate who I am. I can’t live with myself. I feel like everyone I interact with thinks I’m all of those things, and I can’t stand it. I hate everything about myself. My voice, the way I pronounce things, my mannerisms, my sense of humor, my conversations with people, everything. I can’t take it anymore.

Right now I’m on 50 mg Zoloft. Tonight I’m going to trip on 300 mg robotussin gels. There’s a possibility I could experience extreme even fatal side effects due to serotonin syndrome, but I don’t care anymore. I just want to be taken out of this reality for a while. It’s not even that I’m suicidal. I’m not trying to kill myself. But if that’s what ends up happening, I don’t care. I just don’t want to be here.",veelively,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/feddpq/i_dont_care_about_living_anymore/

My former best friends only talk to me and listen when they're bored and nobody else is there to talk to. I started having thoughts of suicide near the end of seventh grade, but it's really gotten worse this year as more is expected of me and my friends cast me further away. 
I decided to finally talk to someone this year, since my previous hints of needing help went unnoticed by my mom. On a day where I felt very low mentally, I told my mom I was suicidal. I broke down crying, and she hugged me. However, she said, ""Don't EVER even think about killing yourself. Do you know what that would do to me?"" I was a little upset about her reaction, as she seemed more concerned about herself. But I kept telling her more. I told her about how I thought I had depression, and she dismissed it as ""stress"" and said it would stop if i started to be positive. I was taken aback by this. I love my mother a lot, but she's never been good at giving advice or helping with my mental health. I got mad at her and began yelling about her never understanding or helping with my feelings. I was a little too extreme, but the anger was not irrational. She yelled back something about her trying to help with the grief counselor (1. She didn't help very much. 2. She was there to help us deal with grief over a family death, and she didn't help with my suicidalness). What made me feel worthless was when she yelled, ""What do you want me to do about it?"" and told her I wanted her there for me to talk to and she went on about my grades, what have I told you, learn to deal with your emotions better,  etc. I ran off crying to continue my homework. A few minutes later she came in with her phone and my dad was on a call. She had told him. She was mad about me not focusing on my homework and I needed to hurry it up and finish and stop crying. I kept crying, upset she didn't help, and a few minutes later my dad arrives. He was upset that I wasn't working on the project and ""wasting time"". I kept crying until he started yelling to stop crying. I stopped, tears welling in my eyes. I love my dad too, but he can't control his anger very well, and he follows his parent's ways of discipline, which is what he grew up with. As he lectured me I started clawing my arm to calm myself like I always do. He noticed me leaving scars on my arm and got angrier. He told me to stop and said this: ""Do you want me to do it for you?"" This really upset me, but I said nothing to avoid an argument. He got me to finish the project. He said he cared about me and loved me, and he left. No discussion of my mental state. My mom called him when i started crying later and he wasn't mad this time. He told me to go to sleep and feel better. I didn't feel better when I slept.
I just needed to get all that out.... I've been considering suicide a lot, and I know there's ""help everywhere"" like hotlines and such, but it won't help. I need people I care about to talk to. I lost my grandma in December of 2018 to cancer. She listened and cared. I have no one I know of now. My friends don't listen, and I feel like they think I talk about sad stuff too much. I just need to know what to do, because I honestly don't know anymore. The people I care about most can't help me, and I feel worthless. I never know what to talk about, and when i get to talk for once, my friends look at me different than they do at other friends. They look lost, bored, and like they want me to hurry up and get it over with. Then they go back to talking to the other people. I just need some advice... if you read this whole vent then you are an amazing person and I hope you have a wonderful day.",LynxxArt,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe9zs9/my_parents_dont_take_my_suicidal_thoughts/
Drinking keeps me alive,It used to be something I did once every couple weeks at a party when I was a teen. Now it makes me happy. I love waking up still hungover with brain fog. It gives me this fuzzy feeling I used to feel with my SO. I know it’s terrible for me. I still work out but that only gives me an hour high. I’ve realized if I’m sober my thoughts consume me and when I’m drunk everything’s ok. My family and friends wonder how I do it but I guess I like the depressing hungover feeling.,rememberthememoriez,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe7ip2/drinking_keeps_me_alive/
Thinking about suicide more and more,"I am in a very dark place right now. I'm 32. I've been unemployed since last October after getting laid off (not due to performance, my whole team and 15% of my company got let go) and do not have a firm idea of what to do with my life. I have started to interview again over the past few weeks but they are mostly for the same type of work (which is pretty niche, not a ton of jobs available) and I just don't know if this is what I want to be doing for the rest of my life. In the meantime, I have been getting dicked around by recruiters and just feel like I'm getting left out to pasture even though I feel like I have a good background and interview well.  


Simultaneously, I am finishing up a part-time MBA program which I feel like has been a colossal waste of time, money, and energy. I honestly feel like I had better luck getting responses to job applications BEFORE starting my program. I have been slogging through my final semester, struggling to find the motivation to do my work. I finish in about 2 months, at which time I may or may not be employed again. I just don't know. It's extremely stressful. I will need to begin paying my college loans within 6 months of graduating and don't know how I am ever going to save for a down payment. I immensely regret going to business school.  


Add to this the fact that, for whatever reason, I seem to be getting ignored by just about every therapist I've reached out to for counseling. Maybe I need to start leaving messages that I'm thinking about ending it. I feel like I am losing my mind, and the only thing that keeps me feeling sane is my girlfriend, who without I'm not sure what I'd do. Unfortunately, she doesn't know about my compulsive  masturbation/porn addiction which seems to be consuming my life at the moment. I'm a \*\*\*\*ing mess and I don't know what to do.   


It's hard for me to think about actually killing myself, but I find myself thinking about it often. It gives me some sort of dark solace knowing that I could end it, donate everything I have (which isn't much) to some charity, and be remembered as more than a living nobody, which I feel like I am today.",spatula24,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe4hte/thinking_about_suicide_more_and_more/
I needed a mother,"You always hear how women fear they won’t love their child if it’s adopted which in most cases isn’t true. But in our case it seems to be true. Thank you for all the nice Christmas gifts you gave me. But you never gave the sense you cared about me. You were never there for me. I’m always getting blamed for things and It always feels like you just shrug me off. I never felt comfortable coming to you for advice and you never asked. Why is the connection between us nonexistent? You taught me about my period, you gave me a book that explained puberty. You never taught me about sex. You never ask if I have a boyfriend. You never ask me anything. You don’t really know me at all. I try to talk to you and you seem annoyed when I do. I come to you for guidance about what I should major in and you just judge me for not being able to make up my mind. You’re always petty when I give you attitude but you don’t ask why. I’ve been depressed since I was 12 years old and you never noticed. You never helped me with school and hated that I wanted my license and I’m trying to get my citizenship and you couldn’t care less that I’m not one. When I didn’t have health insurance you didn’t care. When I wanted braces you never helped me until I finally became old enough to do it myself. I don’t have anyone to tell my secrets to. I don’t have anyone to guide me and I feel bad because you’re always alone but it doesn’t seem like you care and want me near you. You get offended Everytime I hang out with dad but never want to do anything with me. I don’t know if you think you’re a good parent but you’re not familiar to me. I just want a mother.

Divorced parents,"Hey can any of you all relate to this? I’m 22 year old male . My Parents divorced when I was 13. While they were married, my siblings and I witnessed verbal abuse, threats, dad pushed our mom, mom crying, dad coming home drunk, and even after the divorce they constantly talked bad about each other . Since the divorce, I became really sad and it follows me until this day. Some days I’m happy and then there are days where I cry myself to bed. The day they divorced, police had to come to the house because my dad was trying to hurt my mom. Soon after I witnessed my younger brother change from an innocent child to a drug addict. My father was an alcoholic who is now dead. My mother had the nerve to say to me “I don’t why your brother is like this... he didn’t have it that bad.” My mom really doesn’t know the trauma she caused me and my brother. My brother was vulnerable. He needed someone but I was too young to realize he needed help. Not until now . I was gone In the military when he spiraled out of control.

"Everytime I think I'm finally doing well, for even a second, something else happens which fucks me over.","I just feel like something put there is telling me to kill myself. It just keeps throwing shit out me till I give up. I think I can finally take a breather. And then theres something else to stress about. This time, I was about to be late on rent. But I did all I could to get the money together. (I'm not even gonna say all the things I did to get the money) but then. I just got off work. And I was about to swing by the bank to withdraw the money to lay rent. But then my car wouldn't start. And I'm completely alone in this state. So I had to call someone to come out and jump me. But it wouldn't jump. So I had to spend money to get it towed. Then the damn mechanic shop jerked me around, and ended up fighting with them alot ( I use to be a mechanic so I know when I'm getting jerked around) but they were so incompetent, that it took them 6 hours to basically figure out that the battery needed to be replaced and then do it. They lied to me when they told me the tested the battery when they first pulled it in the bay. They put a new starter on, without telling me until after the fact. And then told me my engine was seized up due to there being 0 oil in it. Which I dont know if I believe, because I just got my oil changed about a week and a half ago. And I know I dont have a leak. So either they were lying or the technician at the luge shop didnt put oil back in my car. But anyway, long story short. They forced me to pay 600$ for basically a battery change. And then I had to go back to work 2 hours later, with no sleep since my last shift. So that was great. But that 600$ was going to be for my rent. No I dont have any money.

I hate the way I look,"Nowadays people are starting to embrace body positivity and are learning to love who they are. So why can’t I? Every time I look in the mirror all I see are flaws. My stomach bulges out too much, my face is fat, my acne is ugly, I need to shave, my teeth are yellow, my butt’s too small, etc. Why can’t I see the good in myself?

My biggest insecurity is my stomach. I can’t help to think that I’m fat even though I have an average BMI at 5’5” , 140 with playing a sport/working out every day.  I think this insecurity sort of stems from everyone around me being stick thin. This one girl in my grade keeps saying how “fat” she is when she’s half a foot taller than me and weighs less. I know that shouldn’t bother me but it does. I also am a gymnast and seeing everyone around me be thin and look good in leotards makes me feel awful.

After eating a lot, I can’t help but be so mad at myself later for putting on so much weight, but sometimes I just can’t help it. I like food. It’s gotten to a point where my lunch is just a granola bar and I’m just hungry throughout my day.

It drives you to do things you'll never forgive yourself for,"I remember the past few weeks were the ones in the summer where I wasn't able to see you much. I felt so sick, not because I couldnt see you, but because I knew I would. The fact that everytime I seen you, you acted as if you loved me so much. Why did you? I never understood and I couldnt comprehend. I didnt believe you the slightest. And even the day I broke it off with you for the first time, I didnt understand why you seemed to be on the verge of crying. I didn't even say it out loud that I thought we weren't going to last, you just read me like a book. Whenever you read me, did i seem pathetic? All I felt was numb. My heartless self watched you walk away, and the last feeling id feel for a long time walked away too. I wish I could tell you about it all. I loved you so much. I tell these lies, apologizing how I didnt appreciate you enough then, telling lies to my friends about how I really felt. My only desire was to die, the quickest way to get it done was to get rid of you. In the end, I didnt die, but at the same time I did. I didn't even have enough energy to tie a knot or swallow any meds, it even felt so heavy to blink. Im horrible for acting like i hated you after, you acted like you hated me. I dont blame you for it, for me it was just a way to not let my pride down. We grew back together, we were so close. It got to the point we felt for eachother again. But I didnt understand why I was still fucking numb. I didnt want to be with you, I wasnt ready. I wanted to die. Everytime I almost did it, id somehow end up back where I started. I hurt you so much. Somehow, some way, we got through it. You never found out how I really felt. We made it. Im better. I love you so much. Everyday I'm wallowing in self hatred, because of the pain I caused you. Yet you had believed you were in the wrong? I don't understand that, i never will. You're always in my mind.

I can’t believe I’ve gotten this bad,"I understand losing a job. Losing your mom. Getting cheated on and finding out about it in the most cliche possible way. Losing hope in everything. I was so self destructive before and after. Just wanted to not feel. Way before any of this shit started to happen. It’s difficult accepting and understanding what’s happened in the past has effectively shaped you in a negative and positive way. But most of us stop there. I’m stopped there. The negative way, it’s so easy to get caught in that loop. We can be right about some things but it doesn’t change anything. I say I can’t believe I’ve gotten this bad for good. I won’t bore anyone with details of my childhood as we all have a few nights worth of stories. Just know you always have a decision and it’s yours. Right now it’s pretty hard at 25 years old I’ve let myself be manipulated by my own father and my ex. I remember at a younger age feeling like I don’t deserve to feel sad and I shouldn’t. Now I think it’s just a plain joke and I’m being tested. Not religious or whatever didn’t mean that but fuck, life is getting a little too real. I just got a letter from my school they approved a grade change appeal. I just stopped showing up. For 2 semesters. I have my suspicion due to the community I’m from and the major/degree I was going in for they are tight knit and had my back(if you’re from this community you will probably know). When I received the letter my first response was anger that they would let someone like me back. But it’s time to be done with all my self searching. For so long I would be thinking what could I change/tweak about me to make more people like me. What can I change to make me think that I don’t care about what people think even though that was on my mind 99% of the time and stressing me out. I’ve been stuck in the past and it’s time to move on. It’s unfortunate that for so many of us we know something is wrong and we want to change. So many of us don’t know how. I still don’t know how.

Depression or laziness?,"For quite a long time now, I've been restless, not enjoying life at all(anhedonia), and lacking any sort of motivation to do anything at all. For a while I thought I was lazy, but I'm quite a rational person, and even when I've made full sense of why I should get up and do a thing, I recede into doing nothing again. I just don't seem to care enough about anything, nothing seems to be worth my effort. I have no passions or liking to things, I just sit there on my computer all day/TV. 

Most days I see no reason to get up or do anything healthy/productive. It's quite a nihilistic out view I have. I must say, I'm quite optimistic. As contradictory as that sounds I always look on the bright side of things, as it always bodes a better result.

Am I extremely lazy or depressed? I sure feel down most of the time, when I'm with friends it's okay, but it's not like any of my laughs or smiles are genuine however; I feel emotionless most of the time. This has been going on for at least a year or two and I really need to get work done and get on with my life so I don't fall behind. Any help would be appreciated :)",grudg3_,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fecf0u/depression_or_laziness/
I don't want to die but I don't want to exist anymore,"yeah. everything freaking sucks. I'm on spring break and can't go anywhere at all (literally locked in my house all day) because my dad has refused to fix my car and won't let me pay to get it fixed, but then also won't let me use his car because he hasn't given himself enough time to change his breaks. I'm 21 and tired of asking for a ride like I'm 15 again. I feel worthless because I suck at school (I'm in PA school and am struggling in 2 classes) and I won't get any of the scholarships I even apply to because I'm a white female whose dad and stepmother both have great jobs (though we're still not great financially because of shit my biological mother caused), and my GPA isn't good enough. and my professors won't write me a recommendation because I suck at school and iv only known them for about 5 weeks. so now idk if I can even pay for the rest of my school. I can't work during PA school because my days are 15 hours long including class and nonstop studying. I am never going to be good at anything. I have endometriosis and my surgery was supposed to be during the 3 weeks chunk I have off between spring and summer semesters but now I can't because they're booked so I have to spend 9 more months being in pain. I can't go anywhere, I'm trapped here with my own thoughts. I hate my family situation because my dad is rude and critical, my stepmom is a bitch, and my mom ruined my family. there is literally no point to living because I can't ever have anything I want nor is my life fair in the slightest. fuck it all I want to die but I don't. I just don't want to deal with anything anymore. I wish I was never born because god obviously just fucking wants to make my life so damn hard and at this point I feel as though I was set up to be depressed.

I feel like life would be easier to give up rather than fighting constantly with myself, but my family would be distraught over me hurting myself and they’ve done a lot for me so I’m resorting to telling people on the internet in the hope that someone knows how to deal with dark thoughts and the lack of emotions that I don’t feel anymore. - Cereal",Cereal420Blaziken,9,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fec7t8/dealing_with_major_depressive/
Venting a bit,"I realized recently that I might have bipolar disorder based on a couple of friends I know who have it and also the symptom checklists that I have looked at. I have been diagnosed with general anxiety as depression but lately it’s felt more than that, particularly in the swings between extreme optimism and sociability, and pessimism’s day depression. 

Anyways I was looking online and found an online counseling website. One of the boxes you have to fill out is info that the counselor will look over in order to have a better understanding upfront. As I was filling it out I poured my heart into it and explained my feelings better than I ever had to anyone before, even myself. I was feeling like there was hope in figuring out what the fucks going on in my head. Then I hit the “next page” button and it brought me to the payment section.

Never did the website mention that it was a paid thing up until this page. I understand that it’s a business and the counselors have to get paid somehow in order to not do a completely shit job, but the fact that they didn’t mention that until you’ve already broken yourself down and opened up really pissed me off. It felt like they were saying, “okay what’s going on, what’s wrong? Oh no that’s unfortunate, now before I give you any help for all of the super personal stuff you just opened up to me about, I’m gonna need your credit card info. Oh you can’t afford it, well fuck off then.” 

It’s 3:23 am where I live and I feel completely stuck. I am a college student working two jobs just trying to make ends meet while also juggling the exhausting unpredictable bullshit in my head everyday, and the fact that I have to pay for help with something I didn’t ask for and wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy kind of astounds me at the moment. I don’t know where I’d be if I had visited the site without the semi level head that I have right now and had been hit with that price tag for my well being.

Can I say I have a mental health condition to an employer even if I haven't been diagnosed?,"Hello I am certain that I have been suffering from anxiety and depression for a number of years. As a result I completely withdrawn myself from society but the end of last year it was time for me to get a job, try and put myself back out there and hopefully make myself live bit more comfortably, and maybe give myself a chance of recovering life in my late 20s. I also believe I have dypraxia as I have difficulty talking to people in certain situations but I have complete fluency in others.

However, having got this job I'm experiencing a number of things of which I have experienced in every role since I have been working and that is people are quick to jump to conclusions, and this isn't me being paranoid. This is an accumulation of experiences that are similar for me and I know what will happen in a few months I'll be the most hated person at that job and everyday I go, they will most likely give me hell.

Can I say I have a mental health condition to my employer if I haven't been diagnosed? I don't really want them to personally attack me every time I enter a new workplace because I would like a chance of living too. Why are people so quick to assess one another then give them hell because one person front talk properly? 

I really needed a job which is why I never said anything about a mental health condition as I believe this would have almost certainly affected my chances. 

What should I do? Because if I don't do anything then I know what will happen during this adventure of employment, I will have to leave because of comments and accusations that aren't true. Something doesn't seem right there. Also, I know there is something wrong because hardly want to talk to anyone nowadays. I have no friends out of choice as an example. I dreamt of working very insular jobs growing up. Well may as well kill myself because no one can help they can give me placebos but they won't give me the one thing which will cure depression and other mental illnesses in an instant but they can't give me the job I wanted to do with my life so tell me what is the point?

Knowing that people cared about me made me want to kill myself even more.,"A month ago I was feeling suicidal. During that period I had a conversation with my son's 16 year old cousin from his mom's side of the family. During our conversation he mentioned to me how much he cares and looks up to me and how I was the only adult he could talk to about girls, his problems, and guitars (shit all teenage boys like to talk about). After our conversation I started thinking about what he said and about all the people in my life that care/depend on me (my son, parents, friends, etc.). And for some reason it seemed like more of a reason to kill myself. I found comfort in knowing that if I killed myself I would be missed. I knew they would be sad for awhile but eventually they would move on and think about all the good times we had. I liked knowing that despite my decision I would die knowing I had an impact on someones life.

Has anyone else felt that way?

Whatever happens I just don’t care nothing bothers me or phases me I’ve been so unhappy for so long and no one even knows what goes on in my mind. I feel like it’s never ending.

At least I have a family, but will I just live with my mom forever? without ever having my own house, my own money, my own life?

Everything seems so uninteresting and boring. I'm just so tired of having no motivation to chase my goals. I feel like I once I had the potencial to have a good life, but somewhere on the way I lost my purpose. I'm still young but I feel like I've missed out on so much already.

I hate myself. I hate my inability to live a normal life.

Guess I'll just listen to sad music, drink alcohol, masturbate to porn, and cry myself to sleep tonight like every other day. At least I get to feel something. My mind is so broken, I'm just a piece of trash, a sad excuse for a human being.

I'm a talentless loser. Even If I wanted, I couldn't be succesful in any career or job. I'm too slow, too dumb.

This sub is nice to chat with other people in a similiar situation, but it's also just an illusion. It's not like anyone here cares about me either. Every single day I think about comitting suicide and I really feel like I'll do it in the next few days.

I guess 2019 is my last year. I'm crying as I type this, I just wish things were different, I wish I was much more than I am now.

Nothing ever seems to go right for me and I’m stuck in this stupid rut and I’m so fucking tired of it. My life is one long loop and I feel like there’s no purpose to any of it and I honestly just want it to be over because I have no idea what to do. I don’t have the energy to do anything I love anymore and nothing makes me happy because even if it’s going well I know that it’s just on the surface and deep down I still wish I was dead. I worthless, like I just take up space and I don’t deserve to get help. My little sister started going to therapy last year after my parents found out she was harming herself but I can’t even count the amount of times I’ve sat on the floor sobbing to my mom about how I can’t take being alive anymore and no one has done anything to try to help me. I’m begging for someone to help because I feel like no one cares. 

The worst part is being tired. I’m so fucking sick of being exhausted no matter what I do. I’m always in a fog no matter how much sleep I get and I can’t focus or think. My head always hurts. I feel like my body is shutting down. I don’t have an appetite and I lost about 20 lbs since the summer. I gained some back and started hating the way I look so that’s going for me too now. Now I don’t eat because 1. it makes me feel sick 2. I hate the way I look 3. I know it’ll hurt me. I’m fucking sick of all of it. 

For my entire life, I’m supposed to have been perfect. I can’t admit any of this to anyone because I’m so scared of being pitied or being vulnerable. My grades are slipping and I don’t know how to deal with it because my entire life is being a perfect student who’s going to get into a perfect college and if I can’t do that I’m fucking worthless and I should just be dead. On top of all that I think I might be a lesbian, and that is one of the things I hate most about myself, more than my body or personality or grades or anything else. 

I think about killing myself every single day but I’m too scared to do it. I have a plan and I have a suicide note written down just in case so it’s ready if I decide to ever do it. I don’t even want to die. I just want all of this garbage to be over. I’m 17 and I feel like I’m not going to make it another year if things keep going the way they are and I’m honestly scared. I just wish I was never born so that I wouldn’t even have to go through killing myself and that way no one would be hurt if I was dead. If I die I don’t have to apply to college or come out or worry about failing any more or eat or hate the way I look or hurt myself or anything because it would all just be over and I wouldn’t have to deal with any of this shit.  I’m so fucking tired of all of it. I can’t even think of a legit reason why I feel this way and that’s what I hate most of all. Everything is going wrong and there’s no tangible reason why and that makes me want to panic. I’m so frustrated and I have no outlet for any of it and I don’t even feel like a human any more. My whole life is barely keeping my head above water in school, coming home and chugging green tea so I don’t eat, and wanting to kill myself when something small goes wrong.

Secretariat was right,"I'm rewatching Bojack Horseman on Netflix for the umpteenth time because that's the only thing I do that I enjoy anymore. 

I've recently noticed that in the show Secretariat is right, that you should never stop ruining, never look back, all that you have is what's ahead. That's what I've been doing and it seems to be working as long as I don't stop. 

My last relationship almost killed me, my ex was abusive. Before her I survived since shit, sexual assaults and the like. I've done terrible things too, things for survival, some things simply because I was a bastard.

Now i keep myself busy. I work 50+ hrs and volunteer  for the entire weekend. I have pets that need constant attention, and I'm constantly moving. When I'm not running around I always have a drink in hand. It works. The only time I look back is when I'm falling asleep,  that's the worst. That's when I can't escape it. Thankfully sleep cones soon. But I need to keep moving. If I stop I'll be consumed. Im terrified of that. I can't handle that. I can't relive it, I just can't. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I come from a long line of alcoholics and I'm fast on my way to join them. I'm so tired but I can't risk showing down.

I hate myself MASSIVELY.,"Okay, here it goes. I don’t really care if this isn’t a throwaway account, it’s whatever.

During the beginning of my teenage years, (13) I didn’t care about anything, how i looked, or anything of that sort. Looking in mirrors was fine, and life was good.

When i hit 14 i sent a really horrible selfie of myself to a group of online friends, was bullied really bad for it, and so on. From then on i’ve been incredibly alert of myself, if you know what i mean. 

I stayed with this friend group because they were the only people i knew and could talk to, my parents hated me for being gay, and my brothers only took in their footsteps. After this, i just completely broke down, got so insecure that i wore a jacket for a year because i was so scared of anyone seeing me. That ended when i was 14. 

I stopped because i just decided to stop feeling sorry for myself and that i was the only problem in that situation. Since then, it’s only gotten worse.

I’ve lost the first battle,"I used to bottle things up. Hope they would just pass without causing any problems... they usually would and because of that I thought it would be a good way to deal with stress and all of that. I was wrong. Ever since I tried being more and meeting more people and making my life more exciting it just hasn’t worked. If anything it made things worse. Stuff just keeps getting added to my bottle and now the cap doesn’t even fit on the top. It’s affecting the people I’m around and I don’t like it but I also don’t want to tell them what is wrong because I don’t want them to worry or be concerned. My feelings are leaking and I don’t like it because they are noticing. I feel like I’m doing more harm to them by not telling them. I just want everyone to be ok but I don’t want them to know...suicide has been a very present thought in my head but I don’t want to leave...it would just hurt them more..hopefully my thoughts on that won’t change or else I won’t be here for long...

Today I hate myself more than I usually do,"I did something stupid. 

I only talk to one person about my mental health. She is the only person who has ever helped me not be depressed. After being depressed and okay-ish at my best for about a decade, talking to her made me feel happy. And it wasn't just for a minute, an hour, or a day. I felt happy for about half a year. 

That was what led me to tell her. I wanted to thank her, and I couldn't say thank you without telling her why. When I told her about my mental health, she was supportive. Even though I haven't felt happy in about five months, I still look forward to talking to her.

But today I did something stupid. I started an argument over something that so trivial that one noticed it. Usually when I am speaking to anyone, I try to think about what I say before I say it, because I would hate to say anything that bothers people, but not today. Today, I when I was with her, I didn't once stop to think about what I was saying. If it came to mind, I said it. 

I didn't think she was bothered until she told tried to tell me something like ""I spend my whole life making sure I don't... Isn't it ironic that that I end up doing that?"" As she said that, I saw her face get red and ber eyes start to tear up a little. And I realized that I was being a fucking asshole. 

She has never asked me to do anything. Not a single time. She has helped me when I am having suicidal thought. She has helped me when I feel like I am about to have a mental breakdown. She has helped me through a lot. And I just go and return the favor by being the worst person to her.

I have been trying to distance myself from her, because in the past couple of months, life just hasn't felt like its for me. I don't think that I should ever feel better. Depression is exactly what I deserve. Everytime I have caught myself feeling a little better, I just tell myself what I have to feel like shit again. Now, I will find it easier to no longer talk to her. As much as I looked forward to talking to her, I look forward to her forgetting me.

There isn't a whole lot keeping me from having the thought that makes me take my last, she is one of the two things that even just thinking of her helps me keep the suicidal thoughts just thoughts. I think she still wants to talk, and I know I will see her for at least the next 2 months, but when those 2 months are up. I won't talk to her, and I will do everything that I can to keep me from ever talking to her again. I don't want to make her sad or ever make her cry again.

Right now, I know I probably won't gather up the courage to end it, because I still have to see her. But I did resently take up self harm. I started by hitting my upper thigh, so no one would see the marks. Recently, I started growing out my hair, so that no one will notice that I started hitting my head. A while after I see her for my last time, the odds that I'll finally do it will rise.

I fucking hate that I possibly made someone feel anywhere near how if feel most of the time. I hate myself even more for doing it to the only person I have ever felt safe enough to tell everything about anything.",IH8MyThoughtsAtTimes,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe9mia/today_i_hate_myself_more_than_i_usually_do/

I kinda need advice?,"So these past few months my mental health has been getting worse and I don’t know if it’s because of these two friends I have, because I don’t want to put all the blame on them. So I met one of them at the beginning of the school year and the other one I’ve known for a while but we never really talked and they were really nice to me and we had lots of fun hanging out after school since we were on the same bus. But as time went on they kinda got mean? One of them would sometimes slap me or punch me in the stomach but when I would stand up for myself they would be like I’m over reacting or something. The other one just confuses me since one day she would be praising me saying “you’re so smart” “ how are you so good at everything” then the next day she’ll be like “ you’re so fucking dumb you’re and idiot” “aren’t you smart so like you’re supposed to know that” “don’t you even know fucking anything” just to make it clear I never really liked having those types of compliments since it made me uncomfortable since it’s like what if I all of a sudden don’t meet their expectations or something. I feel like my “problem” is just me overreacting but I’ve been trying to distance myself but on the bus while they’re next to me I can hear them talking shit about me. I keep to myself around them I don’t talk to them but they still talk to me asking why are you ignoring us. Again I’m probably just overreacting but I just need advice on what I should do since I’ve been getting more anxious and what they say about me gets to my head sometimes.

What depression feels like,"I can’t put it into words all the time but depression to me feels like I go through life with this tight tight pressure just squeezing on my heart all day long and I just have to ignore it and go throughout my day with nobody knowing what’s going on. But when I snap and I cry it’s because the pressure has just built up too much and I just can’t handle it anymore but I only snap in private because once you cry and once those emotions are out of your system and you have momentary relief you think, well that was silly and it’s not that deep I’m fine. And then this cycle of pressure builds up all over again and you just have to pretend like nothings wrong but you’re truly not ok. 
I can’t explain this to the people in my life cause I’ve always thought maybe I’m just making up my depression because I can go throughout my day. I’m not bed bound. But if I reflect on my life, I’ve always tried to cope in some way. I used to binge eat so much and I notice I have the urge to do it whenever I’m feeling especially down. Then it was movies &amp; tv shows I would drown myself in for hours and hours. Then it was music to drown out my own thoughts. It was reading endlessly at some point but I’ve lost all interest in all of those things and I find being awake to be so draining so now all I do is go to my classes and go to sleep. I hate being awake. I hate feeling this pressure in my chest and it sucks because I was free from it for a few months and it’s back and you just try and tell yourself you’re just having a bad day but you know it’s some sort of relapse. It’s hard because I don’t want to take medication, I don’t know if that’s going to make things worse for me and I don’t want to be numb I just don’t want to feel pain. On top of that there’s so much fucking stigma. I can’t talk to my parents about it cause whenever I do they get angry I feel sad because I’m their eyes they’ve given me the perfect life despite all the abuse when I was a child. I can’t talk to my friends cause they’re all optimists with the “it gets better” attitude and it pisses me off cause all I want is to get held and just cry. I always feel like I’m being punished for something and I don’t know what cause I try so hard to be there for others. Whenever I can’t find love and I see ordinary people super happy in relationships I question what’s wrong with me (I’m not saying I’m super attractive but I have assets that would at least attract people). when I start questioning why I can’t find a good relationship or someone who likes me it loops back into my thought of well how do I expect that to happen if my own father walked out on me as a child.

I suppose what I should take away from this situation is that the girl in question is a money-grubbing whore. When I did have some disposable cash she was really sweet and affectionate. Not anymore since this fuckface entered the scenario. I’m really fucking fed up with this.

the first step.,"I've felt this way for a very long time. The feeling of inadequacy, the contempt of others, the anger, and the overwhelming loneliness. For such a long time, I've kept it bottled up, but now its beginning to boil over and I don't know how to handle it.

I've been told by countless people, that I'm a vile person. If you knew what I've done, youd think I was a vile person.

Struggling,"A few years ago I was depressed and suicidal for several different reasons. I thought I worked through it. I thought I was better. But I’m 22 now and for about the last year, things have been gradually getting worse. I’m at the point now where I guess I’m probably passively suicidal? I have suicidal thoughts but I have no intention on acting on it. The urges to self harm have also occasionally come back, but I haven’t done anything.

I’m frustrated because nothing specifically happened to bring me back here. It just happened. I’m really struggling to see the light at the end of the tunnel. It feels like I put all that work in for nothing, I’m almost right back where I was and why keep putting so much effort into something that’s futile and I’m always just gunna end up here again.

I’m not quite at my lowest low, but I’m afraid if something doesn’t change I’ll get there. I guess for as long as I’m scared of being suicidal that’s hope.

Idk, I feel lonely and the few people close to me wouldn’t understand. I know that sounds cliche but truly none of them have had depression, and when I’ve tried approaching it they say something cliche and unhelpful like “things will get better I promise.” Or “try taking a walk, the sun and movement always helps me” Like yeah wow thanks I never thought to do that before lol. Granted maybe it’s partly my fault bc I haven’t really said the full extent of it so they don’t know how bad it is. But I still just don’t think I’d get anything helpful from them.

And idk if I’m gunna get anything helpful from here either and I’m not even really sure what my point is with this post, I’m just venting.

I feel like I'm doomed to just have bad luck,"I'm not a believer of anything spiritual or supernatural, but it truly does feel like I was cursed with bad luck or some shit.

A lot of it is just small things. Constantly getting the worst loot in video games, missing the public bus by like 30 seconds, etc. I always make small personal bets with myself like if I get a notification on Instagram I'll just be like ""I bet this specific person didn't like this post"" and I look at the notification and it's exactly that. This kind of shit is constantly happening everyday. By themselves it's not bad at all, but it really builds up and starts eating away at you.

And then there's bigger things. Like being 5'2 as a male is pretty bad. I have mental illnesses and some of it I can't even relate with other mentally ill people. I get bronchitis like every fucking year. And then tonight, I just got news that a field trip to Hawaii that I've been looking forward to for FOUR FUCKING YEARS has been cancelled because of the coronavirus bullshit. Of course it had to be the ONE FUCKING YEAR IM A SENIOR AND ABLE TO GO.

It just all piles up so fucking much. I feel like I'll just constantly have bad luck in life. It makes me lose excitement in things I'm actually excited for because I'm just in that mindset that it'll go wrong because of my bad luck. Makes me wonder if it's even worth living if I'm just stuck with this shit.

 I hate my life, my family is horrible and struggling too. The world is fucked, people are disgusting; everyday I wish for a quick fucking death. I'm failing in school, I have no passion in what I do anymore and even better I don't know what I wanna be in the future.

It's funny, I went to one of those subreddits to make a friend in, and they fucking downvoted me. What a way to boost my confidence Internet. And make a friend. Fuck I hate myself.
I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. I want to sleep forever, I don't want to wake up tommorow to do my mock. I know I'll fail it. I'm a fucking failure.
Ask for help? I'm too worthless to ask, I won't accept it, I have too high standards or whatever. Idk. I've become the very thing I've sworn to destroy and that's a depressed sad fucking failure. I don't know what to do.
I'm just another one of the millions asking for help only to not take it. I'm unmotivated to do anything. God I want to cry so much.

I’m fucking tired of being bullied over my disability,"So I’ve been dealing with this since the day I started medical school which was about 5 months ago . I’ve done my best to handle it all by myself but I’m fucking done . There’s no one around to talk to about it . I was diagnosed with Bell’s Palsy in 2015 , it recovered to some extent but didn’t go away . For the past 5 years every stranger I’ve met has in one way or another made fun of me , it was bad but in University it’s beyond fucked up . I haven’t had a single day when nobody laughed at me because of how FUCKED UP MY FACE IS . 
I used to be a pretty attractive person , I can’t hold my tears while writing all this . I still remember the time when I used to be pretty confident because of the way I looked . Now it’s just a dream . Every stranger I’ve met has in one way or another made fun of me . I am forced to stay alone everyday in school , my anxiety won’t let me move a muscle . Whenever or if ever  a stranger approach me with a smile , the moment I do the same they get confused and literally the first thing I’m asked is “what the fuck is wrong with your face?”
No body wants to be friends with me because they think I’m just a fucking retard who somehow made it into med school . 
Dating is just a whole another set of nightmares . I get rejected hardcore because of my face which completely disturbs my mental health . 
I feel helpless right now . Sometimes I get bullied to a point where Its feel like the only way to avoid all this is if either I commit suicide or the person trying to bully is gonna have to pay with their life .

Does it make sense to have a pet dog if you are experiencing depression?,"I ADORE dogs. I love them more than humans, but I'm not the type of person who goes crazy whenever they see a ""cute little dog"". Actually I don't really lay a single hand on random dogs I come across to show them love. I just love their personality, and their loyalty. Almost at levels that it brings tears to my eyes even when I just think about their pure loyalty. 

Having a dog friend would help with my depression vastly, and the thought of it brings a smile to my face...  Until I think of their eventual deaths. The fact that they won't be able to live long enough, and the fact that I knowingly make a close friend whose death will wreck me keep me away from this thought.

I don't know what to say, and I would feel guilty saying this to the people around me because I will bother them. 

I told it to my best friend but she is suicidal and severely depressed and she started to self harm again after I told her I self harmed and I don't want to make her feel worse. I want to support her although I don't have the strength to do that. I told it to a friend and to my sister as well and although they are helping and kind, I don't want to tell them how bad I feel. I don't know how to.

I tried to see psychologist but I have to wait untill at least april. This is a free psychologist and I can't afford to see another one earlier if it means I have to pay. My credit card has been stolen anyway lol.

Anyway, my way of coping with all of this is to put myself in danger and make myself feel physically bad in the hope I will feel more valid in my suffering and that I will finally be able to ask for help and feel like I deserve it.

"""Chemical Imbalance""","&gt; **[Trigger Warning: self-harm descriptions]** I found this in my notes in my phone from 4 years ago. I forgot how much I used to write about what it was like living inside my mind back when I was at my lowest point.

**Chemical Imbalance**  

It always starts with something taken out of proportion. A misread text, a misunderstood gesture, a misjudged opinion, or a misguided tone.  
“I love you.” They attempt to bring you back to a reasoning reality.  
But love isn't *love* anymore.  
Love is fake.  
Love is wrong.  
Love is *hate*.  
*I hate you*. Their mimicked voice echoes.   
Triggering the avalanche of spiteful words spraying from your pale lips.   
*They hate you*. The voice darkens.  
You watch them slowly fall into your torturous whirlwind of abuse. You watch them cry for help and ask for you to stop and listen to yourself, listening to you hate yourself and want to die is too much for them.  
Then you watch them leave. You watch them run away in fear.   

Your bony fingers crack as they clench into a fist. Your jagged nails are digging into your skin.   
Anger engulfs your vision, taking control of rationality.  
The first blow strikes hard on your face. It stings, but you go a second time. And a third. Until your head starts ringing.   
*You seriously fucked up this time*. The dark voice echoes.  
You can't see anything for what it really is.  
“But you said they hated me!” You argue with the little self-worth you have left.   
*Yes, and you believed me. You stupid little girl*.  
That restless feeling of guilt starts trickling down your spine. Did you jump to conclusions? Did you just impulsively hurt a loved one’s feelings? Did you just make them witness something so traumatic it will never leave them?  
*Yes, you're a twisted abuser*.  

No, you can't be here. You can't be alive anymore. You don't deserve it. You have hurt someone who needs you, you have acted out of spite.  
*Do it. You're worthless. They don't want or need you here*.  
More impulsive actions unfold, you only want to escape the guilt and anger that overfills your head. But you're scared to do it. You're scared to make the final exit by your hand.   
*Cowardice. You can't live and you can't die. You are pathetic*.  

The razor is in view. Tears are finally pushing out, causing more pain than the blade that now pierces your skin. Scarred and thin, the skin breaks. But no satisfaction is found unless you cut too deep. Only disappointment seeps in, blaming yourself for your cowardly slashes. Not going deep enough, pathetic little scratches. Why can't you feel more pain? Why can't you cut deeper?   
*You fail at even the simplest things*.  
You cut more. Faster, harder. You want centimetres, not millimetres.  
But still the same depth, still the same shit.  

There’re too many cuts now. But still no pain, only numbness from the raw wounds you view.   
But the blood won't stop. Your wrists are painted. Like stained crimson cloaks wrapped around each arm.   
You slip in the dark puddle and feel the red wetness of the towel you clench.    
“Take me!” You scream.   
“Please just take me!” You keep screaming at the otherworldly force.   
Pleading for the way out, pleading your heart would just stop.   
Now a mess of tears and blood on the floor, you weep.   
The sounds of silence bounces in your head.  
The dark voice is gone.   
Nothing.  

A door opens.   
The realisation of someone witnessing the mess you are in kicks you up.   
You can smell the shame from your cold sweat. You can see the damage you've caused yourself and the one who is about the enter.  

“I'm sorry.” You whisper.   
You are numb and frozen as they wrap the bandages around your wrists.   
“I'm sorry.”   
You can see the pain in their eyes. You can feel the fear in their trembles. You can hear the confusion in their silence.  

*You don't deserve this love*. The dark voice echoes.   
And then you fall back into the abyss.",poppi__054,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fea7zb/chemical_imbalance/

I was once proud of this and now i see it as a neutral thing, but i joined the army. at first i loved the comeraderie, pt, rucks, etc. and basic was a lot of fun with the grenades, obstacle courses, etc. but now im an academic fail out from AIT (job training in the army). its really painful living as a holdover. for those who are thinking ""wtf is a holdover?"": a holdover is someone who for whatever reason failed from their training, got injured, or in at least moderately serious trouble. the job of a holdover is mostly sitting on bleachers all day near the drill sergeants officespace until the end of the workday.  they will sometimes clean or perform some paper work on occasion. i contribute nothing, do nothing, and all the while watching my old friends earn the exact position that i spent the last several months of working my heart out for. im not angry at them, so much as i am just really... frustrated. because of my jobs academic difficulty, this is really not uncommon but ive been stuck here as a holdover for over a month now. 9 hours per day, 5 days per week, of sitting and doing next to nothing. i feel like a drain on society while also miserable with the ""work"" i am doing. 

i used to think that i wasnt contributing to anything while training but was fine with it because my job was to learn to be a soldier. but now i have no job, no purpose, and none of the old freedoms i had as a civilian as a consolation. i still have to abide by the ""battle buddy"" system in which soldiers in basic and AIT cannot ever be without another soldier around except for very specific circumstances. i am not allowed off base (which is less than 2 square miles of space). and i cannot have things like electronics during the time in which im ""working"" to pass the time. this has all made me thoroughly reexamine my reasons for every decision ive ever made.

at first when i failed out i knew id be sent to a new MOS (army job). id hoped for armor (tank stuff), artillery, infantry, or really just anything except for signals (computers, which frustrate me to my wits end), medical (im afraid of needles), and transport (i hate working on cars). and the drill sergeant said the best case scenario, id be sent off to be an IT specialist. i was nothing short of devastated. 

Just one month ago, i was what youd think of when you thought of a bubbly, outgoing, and motivated soldier. Today i realized i had an issue when a drill sgt that i very much look up to came back after being gone for a few months and she noticed that i was showing signs of being ""off"" before i even really said anything. 

I used to be really great at pt, and now im doing so poorly that i may get kicked out of the army entirely. im stressed, saddened by my prospects, and overall just ashamed of where i am. if it werent for my gf whose been nothing short of incredible, there is no way i would have ever made it this far. but now it feels like in the process of joining the army, i started walking from new york to california, i was getting close to nevada until i tripped, got knocked the fuck out, and woke up in ohio. and now im just staring at the map thinking how itd be so much easier to just turn back and cut my losses.

"I’ve lost 4 pounds since Monday, this is just getting worse","I don’t like to complain and so I don’t talk about my depression a lot to my friends/loved ones, I don’t want to worry them or be annoying. It’s been getting progressively worse recently though, I’m dropping weight like crazy (I’ve never had it interfere with weight before), when I do try to talk about it, things get minimized and nobody really gives a f*ck. I had my s/o tell me that I was “not really sad” yesterday, and that messed with me because not only has he not known me for the majority of my life, but just because I don’t like to talk about my problems doesn’t mean they don’t exist. He really has no idea. My mom is a therapist so when I try to talk to her she just gets overly worried, and my dad generally follows her lead with that. I understand why they worry, a couple years ago I had a pretty bad suicide attempt and a near fatal overdose (od was an accident, I was just being dumb) within less than 6 months of each other, they worry that it’ll happen again. It gets annoying though because I feel like I can’t even say I’m sad without “are you on drugs again” etc. Now that I think about it maybe this post doesn’t make sense/ is all over the place, I guess it’s easier to vent to strangers on the internet than the people in my life.",[deleted],1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe407t/ive_lost_4_pounds_since_monday_this_is_just/

Why does no one talk about consent and decision making in a more serious context with depression?,"Recently, im going through a severe depressive episode and I did some things I would not have otherwise done that are now affecting my mental health further and affecting someone I love. 

I would like to hear those with severe depression talk about whether they feel they have the ability to consent and make decisions on sensitive matters during severe depressive episodes.

It feels like society tells everyone that it is their fault if they make a bad decision, that they are responsible for their choices, and most dont understand mental illness properly and to me its not that black and white. 

I want to know whether you think you truly have the capacity to be at fault for a decision youve made if it is something you would not have done outside an acute depressive episode.

Four abilities are usually assessed with decision making when I was looking around. The only studies I found were for research purposes (which saddens me, but thats a whole other topic).

The four abilities:
Understanding
Appreciating
Reasoning
Ability to express a choice

Now I cant say I know the exact ways to interpet these 4 things right now without further research but, do you feel you possess these abilities during a severe depressive episode? Do you possess some and not others? Does it vary? 

My answer would be during a severe depressive episode, I do not possess any of these reliably at every moment. It is not consistent enough for me to able to say I possess any of them during these times.

Need help,"Hi I don't really know how to phrase this situation but I'll try. My life is at a really good point right now, I'm never really depressed over stuff and 99 percent of the time my mind is clear. I'm about to graduate high school and I'm really excited. However, people in my family and friend group have tons of issues. Wether they sleep all day, hate themselves, or have no ambition to keep living on in this world, they've got problems. I don't wanna sound like I'm gloating, but usually I'm the person that a lot of these people end up going to because usually I'm able to talk people through issues and help them in the long run. Yeah sometimes their issues make me really sad and stuff because who doesn't feel sad when people are telling you they feel worthless.

But today one of my best friends showed me that he was cutting and it really effected me. I talked to him about it and it's mostly because of how painfully ""bored"" he is and he doesn't even know why he's doing it (he's a pretty logical guy). He will go to class and just sit there for and hour most of the time doing nothing challenging because that's the way our school works. He has clinically diagnosed depression, has been to a psychiatric ward, and sees a therapist regularly. It's only been a couple hours since he showed me his arm, and I didn't even see all of it. 

I've got two main problems right now. First I don't really know how to help him. He said literally the only thing I can really do is just hang out with him after school and on the weekends so he doesn't just sit in bed all day. I've been trying to make an effort to do that as much as I can but I need to do more. He said himself that as long as he goes to highschool, and considering it's the law, he's going to feel this way until we graduate. I just need to know something I can do to help him, do I tell his parents? A therapist won't help he already goes to one. Should I talk to him more about it tomorrow. I just don't know

Second, stuff like this is really effecting me. I just feel that the world is being unfair to everyone I care about and I just want everyone I love to feel better. As of lately I've been feeling depressed whenever my friends need to talk about issues and it's really weighing down on me. I just don't want to leave the people I care about down in the dirt. 

So yeah if anyone has any advice whatsoever please help me. Im normally able to deal with these feelings and help my friends but right now I'm struggling. Thank you ❤️",F4GG0T_,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe1qdq/need_help/

I miss going out and being able to socialize and I miss like dating and stuff and wearing clean clothes paying bills on time and not being behind miss having a drivers license and not being in fear everytime I get behind the wheel, miss having the Apartment for having girls just come over when ever they want, I miss eating good I miss shopping for things, 

Im barely living  and have been doing that for the past 3 years 

Everytime I get a job I try and fix my credit, and I can never seem to keep with it

I have to live my life with zero payments and buy everything with cash because I clearly can not keep up with them

Sometimes I wish my life was worse so I can receive sympathy,"My life, from an outside perspective, is objectively comfortable . I’m not terribly rich, but I have a roof over my head and food on my plate, with money to spare for my hobbies. I have a group of close supportive friends. 

I have depression. I’ve had it on and off since I was 11, but it’s been consistently bad for the past year. Everyday is filled with excruciating pain and loneliness.
But I often wish it was worse. I’m ashamed to admit that I sometimes wish my parents died all of a sudden or that my house will burn down or that I’ll get in a bad accident so that I’ll receive public sympathy. I’ll FINALLY have something concrete to complain about! Because guess what? Right now, I *don’t* have much concrete things to complain about. At least not things I can tell people publicly.

I guess another way to put it is that I’m desperate for attention, although I don’t like the connotation that comes with that phrase (as true as it may be). My head’s constantly battling these dark thoughts. My life is a living hell, and I’m frustrated that nobody’s taken notice, when it’s my own damn fault I’m not opening up to anybody. 

Man... I’m just so tired. I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up for. Everyday I think that this is the last straw.

And I was like, “BAD BRAIN!!!!!”

Life is just a cruel joke,"Do yall ever feel so numb and empty, but at the same time you feel so much pain and emotions ? And its so confusing but what are you gonna do about it ?  
Just last week I was feeling better, and now I'm back at the bottom

I don't understand. I have an amazing boyfriend and friends, my family is shitty but I know they do love me, I've just suffered from so much emotional trauma from them.

And I do feel happy sometimes. When I'm with my friends and boyfriend all we do is talk and laugh, but when I'm alone I feel so hopeless. Which makes me wonder if I'm actually even depressed.

It hurts, everything hurts so much.  
I just found out my, ""best friend"" who I've known for 6 years, doesn't want to be my friend anymore. Because I've been so busy with school, and I've been so stressed and just exhausted I haven't seen her in a few weeks and then I found out today from her brother.

My family is a wreck, my mom is always telling me about all her problems and I have to listen and counsel her, I'm just a teenager mom,  I wish you would take me to that doctors appointment like you promised you would so maybe I could actually get some help, instead of running off and leaving for days to God knows where.

I haven't been to church in weeks, church has always been so important to me, but lately I don't want to go, I don't want to see the people there that I've known since I was a baby. I don't want to do anything in my free time but lay on my bed.

I want to cry, I want to cry so badly but I can't. I physically cannot cry, and so I'm just here, shaking, in pain, and at the same time feeling nothing. I'm so scared, I don't want to do this anymore, I can't do it anymore I just want it all to go away. I want to go to sleep and never wake up.

Losing motivation..,"I've always struggled with depression, but I am at the lowest I've felt in a long time, I've pushed most of my friends and boyfriend away, family hardly talks to me.

My rent was just raised and I don't know how I am going to afford it.. I don't have family to turn to financially.

The debt, the fact I can't seem to save or get ahead, I have no one to turn to, I am not really conventionally attractive either.. I just feel lost, depressed, numb, want the stress to go away, even for a moment.

I don't know what's wrong with me.,"Let me start of by saying I'm not diagnosed, I haven't really experienced any traumatic incidents in my life and I have no intention of harming myself.

However, due to events in recent months, I feel so empty, like I don't give a fuck about doing anything. Even feeding myself has become something I try to avoid. I don't take care of my appearance, I do the minimal work I need to get by and I rarely socialize with the few friends I have.

These are part in part to a belief that has formed in my head: life is meaningless. What is the point of doing anything? We slave away through school, to get a place at university, then we slave away through uni to get a good degree, then we slave away in a job we will probably hate to make sure we don't end up on the streets. All this, all this pointless cycle and in the grand scheme if things, it makes no difference.

I think a lot of times to myself, if I were to disappear now, would anything be affected? Have I had any impact at all on the world? Will I even be remembered? The answers are always no. This has produced an emptiness inside me.

The emptiness leads to a lack of people, activities and more, which in turn leave me feeling lonely and unfulfilled respectively. Yet I again feel a lack of desire to do anything. I don't know what this is or why I think like this, but I would appreciate it if anyone could give me some sort of method or exercise to break this cycle.",throwaway22599172i,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe64pv/i_dont_know_whats_wrong_with_me/

Feeling helpless and hopeless,"It's been a hard couple months. 

To break it down in a simpler manner; 
I'm a General Manager at a restaurant, working ~65 hours per week. My husband is 29 years old, diagnosed with Crohns about seven years ago. He has been unable to work for roughly 2 years. About a year and a half ago, he had a surgery that required removing roughly 6 feet of his intestines. Due to us not having health insurance until recently, hes been unable to do follow up appointments or get onto much needed medication to manage his disease. His Crohns is getting worse. We finally got him into the doctor's in January when we got health insurance. They've done several CT scans, and keep finding more and more abcesses developing in his intestines. He has another surgery scheduled for this upcoming Tuesday, but he had to go into the hospital again today, due to an abscess that is bulging out of his stomach. I have two puppies at home. With my husband being in the hospital, and myself working ridiculous hours, it puts a lot more on my plate than I have already with work. I feel like a narcissistic POS wife, because while my poor husband is in the hospital, I'm more worried about how much more stress has been put on me. 
I've been through a lot of trauma in my life. A physically abusive father growing up really messed with me, and I'm just now realizing the impact it's had on my every day life. I was in a 4 year relationship with a man who cheated on me the entire time we were together. He abused me physically, verbally and sexually. Manipulated me, and really mentally screwed me over. I was the one paying our bills (on $13 an hour) while he sat at home for 4 years doing absolutely nothing. 
I've been through a lot like I said. Most of these situations I have put myself in. 
I'm constantly tired, unmotivated, and angry. All the time. I've reached a point where I just want to give up. I feel like I'm in a neverending cycle of problems. I fix one thing, and three more bad things get thrown at me. I'm working my ass off every day, plus some, and I have nothing to show for it, since we are so far into medical sent that we are scrounging for money. I'm 25 years old and I feel like I'm 50. I've had several panic attacks over the past couple months, many if which have happened multiple times per day. Anytime I go to the doctor for my anxiety/depression/ADD, they throw whatever meds they can pull out of their ass at me, and tell me to come back a couple months later. I have tried several medications and none of them seem to do anything for me except zombify me. I've tried journaling, I have tried exercising regularly, i have tried everything i feel like!!! I dont know what else to do. My friends are no longer existant, and I dont have anyone to talk to.

TL;DR Tell me some kindness you've witnessed or received.

Vacations,"I just got back from a week long stay on the big island of Hawaii. I had some of the coolest experiences from seeing a shark while snorkeling, to being right next to feeding manta rays. It was an amazing trip and I loved it so much. 

But the problem I have is that whenever I have gone on vacations, even when I was young, I would cry and be horribly depressed for the next few days to a week or two. I hate going on vacations because I know that I’m going to feel like shit after. Nothing feels right when I come home and I just want to be spending “one more day” out away from real life. I hate it because I know that I will have to go back to work and that I won’t get another vacation like this for a very long time. I hate that I can’t explain how I’m feeling to my wife because she’s lucky enough not to have to experience depression except from a third person perspective. 

I so badly want to still be out on Hawaii, or anywhere I’ve gone on vacation to, because out there, I don’t have to care about work; I don’t have to care about school, bills, or family drama. I can just be. I don’t want to have to go back to work and school on Monday, but I know I have to or else things will be worse in the long run. I hate that I’m feeling like I shouldn’t have gone to Hawaii in the first place. 

I loved spending all that time with my wife and enjoying that week together. I loved seeing things that I never have before and being somewhere that I haven’t been. I loved having that time to do whatever I wanted and not feeling badly that I didn’t do anything I didn’t want to. I loved the anticipation and excitement leading up to the day we left. 

I think that’s from where a lot of my depression stems: building up the anticipation, then it’s here and it’s so great, but then it’s gone sooner than it arrived, and you go back to anticipating nothing. 

I feel like life is mostly boring, dull, and no one really wants to admit that, so when you get a few days to enjoy yourself, after, it feels like the nothingness deepens and you sink further into it. 

I don’t know if this made any sense or if anyone is going to read this, but I really just want to stop crying and go to bed.",Papyrus_Sans,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe8u6h/vacations/

The girl i have liked since we met 3 years ago likes, and is in a relationship with one of my best and oldest friends i think they were togeather for about a year, then she ditched everyone she knows. so a while ago when my parents thought i was caught up with school they looked at my grades and discovered that i had horrible grades and as they were digging into me i told them i was suicidal and then the talk to me how i need to stay for them and shouldnt want to die. so they sign my up for a therapist wich i talk to twice which after that they stop taking me and just canceled and there are a few hobbies that bring my joy now and they are Piano, filmmaking, prop making, lightsaber fighting, costume making and cosplay, and video games. and so far my piano broke so i cant play that, they didnt sign me up for another semester of filmmaking cus they were too lazy, prop making is becoming un enjoyable, both of my 2 sabers broke, costume making is becoming to frustriating and hard, they say im too old for costumes and that i need to grow up and video games just arent enjoyable anymore. and as im typing this my parents think i got my grades back up to like b-'s and i didnt and now they want to check my grades just to see how im doing (they are still horrible) and i just want to die at this point, i feel like i have nothing left. i dont know what to do. and i know there are people who have it worse than me and are happy and i may just like an overprivlaged child going through a phase, but i dont really see any way out what do i do now.",Gonk_Droid_Sith,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe44n2/help_please/
Feeling lonely and isolated,"Ok so I suffer with seasonal depression, and this winter has been significantly worse than last. Last winter I was around friends, and family. I was at home. This year I'm in a new city. I moved last summer for university, to try and get away from what/who I once was. I have met some amazing people here, but nobody seems to have any time to care for me. 

Heres a quick rundown of my 2020 so far:
I got a shoulder injury, had time out of the gym, was unable to compete because I was too weak. 
My girlfriend of 2.5 years and I split up. 
I developed a drug addiction to cope with the pain. 
I've hated my body more than ever and have lost all appetite and stopped eating. 
Sex drive has plummeted. 
Started hooking up with a girl but couldnt maintain an erection- realised I was using her for hugs and kisses to numb the feeling of loneliness.

I want to go to a doctor but my brain keeps telling me I'm feeling sorry for myself and this is all for attention. I even feel like this writing this post. 

I hate myself and genuinely don't want to die but I can't see any other options. I just want someone to love me",b_i_g-throwaway,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe2ow1/feeling_lonely_and_isolated/

death,"I just can’t stop thinking about it, it’s constant, it’s all i think about. Before i sleep, when i wake up, and whenever my minds not totally occupied. Sometimes i contemplate suicide: the action then followed by thoughts of an afterlife, if there’s even one. I can never stop obsessing over it and normally i’m the one giving advice such as life and so forth, but recently i’ve been actually contemplating “what happens when we’re all dead?” and that just keeps me up and thinking every moment. This is made worse by people telling me “don’t worry it’ll all be okay” or “just live life to the fullest” something cheesy and dumb. Quite honestly, if life is as pointless as i think and as it seems, aren’t we just better off dead? To live is to suffer, pain after pain, at what gain? The humiliation and satisfaction of nothing short of a horrible life. The experiences all meaning nothing once we’re gone, and yet we’re all still here? Why? Just why?

Depression and concentration,"I have been so paralyzed with depression that I often cannot do basic tasks for myself. I just want to stay in bed all day and stay in my pajamas. Even dressing myself is hard and my partner has to help me sometimes.

Lately in therapy I have been learning about how depression impacts the brain. I have been learning about how it impacts concentration and memory. Well, I experienced that completely yesterday. 

Yesterday I took a shower. It was my first shower in a few days. I was dreading it because it seems so hard now. I know it sounds stupid but it just freaking is. Anyway, I was going through the motions but felt so out of it. I completely forgot to wash my hair. WTF? I have been showering myself for the past 25 years and I just forget?

Lol!,All my friends and family are so confused by my increasingly poor life decisions lately and I never have a good excuse. What am I supposed to tell them? That I’m so upset that it feels impossible to prioritize even the most important tasks. That I feel so lost that I don’t give a fuck about the future consequences because of how much pain I’m in now? And why I don’t bother telling anyone? Why I just keep it to myself and don’t even want to use the word depression to describe myself? Because I honestly feel like a little entitled bitch trying to use mental health as an excuse for being lazy but I truthfully have not been content with anything in my life for the past 3 years and it feels like there’s no escape from my mind. I’ve fantasized my suicide several times a day everyday for the last few months even though I have no plans of doing so. It gives me disturbing comfort. It makes me feel justified for making such a mess of my life. I once truly considered myself depressed. But now I don’t consider myself depressed I don’t think.

I don’t know what to write here,"I’m 22. I’ve dealt with depression since Highschool, and I thought I got better for...I was doing great, went to college, got a job...But recently my anxiety has gotten really bad again...I dated this girl for a little over a year, then I felt myself slipping back into that depression (it was a long distance relationship, I’m in Cali, and she’s back home across the country) anyway...I started getting bored I guess with the relationship because it was just like being in a relationship with facetime...We would try to meet up every now and then...But maybe saw each other about 3 to 4 times a year, and the distance just got in the way, and we decided mutually to sorta break it off. We would still FaceTime everyday, we’d pick a movie to watch together and it was just like we were dating still, but I couldn’t tell her I love her anymore. And that’s when my depression started coming back...Well, fast forward a few months, it’s Christmas I’m home, and she spends my whole first day with me and my family. We wound up sleeping together that night, then the next day she has to leave because she has a job in a different state...We talked about what had happened, and she said it didn’t mean anything. And I thought we were going to get back together again. But that never happened. Now, more recently...She started telling me about this other guy she’s dating, and I try to be supportive she’s moving on, so why can’t I? All I can think about is them together, and him making her happier than me, like I wasn’t good enough for her, but if she’s happy with another guy then why do I want her to be unhappy with me? And I just keep having this one thought of them sleeping together. And that won’t get out of my mind. It’s all I think about every time she tells me they’re hanging out. The thoughts don’t stop, so I drink, and when I drink I cut, and I don’t wanna cut anymore so I stopped drinking, and started scratching my fingers to the point it bleeds and scabs over, and it’s only when I get panic attacks, but I get panic attacks every time I think about her, because when I think about her I think about him, and when I do that I see them “together” and what if he’s better than? This is dumb I know because we broke up, but she’ll still call me when she gets off work, or answer when I call her, but she just tells me about the guy, or she could just be talking about anything...But I just see them, and we hang up, and I want to cut, but I don’t. I haven’t cut in about two weeks now, and it’s hard to get over her. Everyone has the one they let get away, and that was mine, and now I just regret not being there for her enough, I don’t know what else I could’ve done though, I only get so much vacation days, and I’m sorta broke all the time...And I want to do something for her but I can’t I just feel so alone and worthless all the time. I keep obsessing over the two of them together, and I just trigger my own panic attacks and I hate this. I wouldn’t actually commit suicide, but the thoughts have started surfacing again...And I know it’s not that I want to die, I just want not to feel this way, and I know it’ll happen in time, but these past few weeks I’ve stopped eating, I’ve stopped sleeping, I just have trouble focusing on things I’m smoking waaay more than I normally do, and I just need help. I can’t get obsessing over this.

Feeling empty,"It's not that I hate working but... no, it is precisely that I hate working. I just can't come to terms with the thought that I'm going to waste a huge part of my life doing things I don't like to do. 
For what? I don't see the point on working hard and achieving all these career goals if the only time I'm going to have to myself would be after I retire — IF I'm ever going to retire and not just drop dead in my 50/60s. 
I'm 27 and I have no idea how to live this life, my supposedly only chance at sentience. I'm depressed due to a lot of things: physical health problems, not being able to find a job that I'm going to at least tolerate, feeling generally lost in life.
I hated all the jobs I've been at, ALL OF THEM. It majorly contributed to my suicidal tendencies and I quit my last job with this awful premonition that if I'm not going to quit asap, I'm going to kill myself. 
My family doesn't understand because 'Everybody's gotta work for a living' (the usual), they kind of resent me now for being like this. I'd gladly drink all the Kool-Aid of this world and be a relatively happy working drone at this point in my life, but my mind just isnt wired that way.
I'm tired of constantly feeling depressed, guilty, angry at this world and myself. I feel absolutely alone, even thought I know that I'm not alone in this type of thinking.

Need another perspective?,"I had a depressive episode so I moved back home, and have had depression for years but never confided in anyone. 

My parents are great and caring, and my mom is even a nurse, like 80% of the time they’re great.

But sometimes my mom can bug me.. like in the waiting room at the clinic while waiting to get recommended for a psychiatrist for depression she says: You still have it right?

Like what?! She has a nursing degree and asked that. I mean she’s usually very supportive but just this small thing makes me very confused. I am doing much better now that I have a routine and am not alone and suicidal everyday but just because you don’t see my depression doesn’t mean My depression went away.

I’ve hid it for at least 6 years and i was very good at it. I’m an actor. But it irks me that she would say that.

I’m 19 and sorta tall sometimes when we’re out shopping or something she talks about things that I’d rather not discuss in the middle of the mall, like “oh, yeah we should discuss when you should attend classes,” and we never discuss this at home.

It feels like she’s justifying my presence, like this is why I’m here with my 19 year old son on a Monday shopping and he’s not in school. Honestly it’s embarrassing and even if Im overthinking it I feel anxiety in public and I really don’t like standing out.

I’m pretty sure my depressions from her side of the family as she and her grandmother have had antidepressants. Don’t get me wrong we’re close and I love her, but sometimes it’s very annoying and any constructive criticism I give the way she responds is never in a way that doesn’t make me feel guilty about pointing something out.

Whenever there’s a problem she seems to blow it out of proportion, and I’ve stopped trying to help because if we go down a wrong street I become implicated in the problem and she makes it feel as if the world is ending even though everything works out. 

Sometimes it feels like she lets things go wrong on purpose, I can’t even count the times we have gone out for something and she forgot her bags, or we forgot to bring some package for the post office, or something similar. Whenever this happens she says “oh I should have thought of that” “I’m so stupid” “I should have known” and it makes me feel as if she is expecting me to remind her of these things. I appreciate all the things she does but if it’s something she organizes for example shopping like I have no control over what she forgets to bring but she somehow makes me feel responsible, or at least I do somehow. 

I just can’t understand this negative side to her and it seems like somethings always wrong and if it is she exacerbates it, I can’t tell if it’s from her depression if she has low self esteem and is hard on herself if she makes mistakes or makes mistakes on purpose, regardless it affects me.

I've been having chronic pain and I'm partially blind,"Hi I'm 23 years old
It was October 2019,
I was having intense headaches and nausea, it was my birthday the 24th. My family thought it was normal because of my period 2 weeks go by the pain is worse and in tense. I was taken to a hospital, and a neurologist saw me and said I had no signs of any problems whatsoever but to make sure he prescribed me declofenac and to get a resonance on my head. 

No tumors where found and the declofenac made my problems worsen, I went to a different hospital where my grandmother sister works as head of emergency and pediatrician. The doctor who attended me stated I was fine and had nothing, I studied for a nursing license and knew the look in the doctors face when I told her I'm still in pain after administrating medication was of ""she just wants drugs"" face. I told my grandmas sister and she told me, that the doctor who attended me they always fight because of her attitude and insinuation on patients. At this time I was already 2 months in pain, my family tried to look for other know neurologist in the field to see what's going on and none of them knew.

3 months I was talking to a friend and just for a moment I felt numb, numb as in I didn't feel any pain. My dad got scared and saw my left eye drift away, he took me to a oftalmologist. He didn't know what's going on when he checked me so he referred me to a hospital specialized in neuro-oftalmologist. I went through the emergency room and I was obviously angry frustrated you name it. The doctor checked my eyes and told me I had papilledema, and it might be cause by the birth control pills since I was always having issues with my hormones. The blood pressured my eyes thus having nausea, headaches, desoroentation, sensitivity to light, and insomnia.

I was treated for papilledema and I can't use any birth control whatsoever, but now I'm still sensitive to light and I see like those huge TVs in the 90s and VHS. Because my left eye was left with nerve damage, I can't see my peripheral view from both my eyes. the left eye its been losing the blur I see and it's getting darker, as in pitch black and have like a 1cm of blurred or I think even less. I'm also not being able to see most colors or differentiate in deepness (as in stairs, steps, holes etc) 

It's been 6 months now..

I changed doctors, learned myself to go through my surroundings without depending in my eye sight. I no longer have papilledema and I still get headaches even when I try to force my eye sigth, plus In December we found out my knees is more above than usual and that's why it pops out. But that time it popped out it didn't went in and now I have to use kinesiology tape to have support and control over it.

I've been snapping at a lot of people degrading me, telling me it's nothing, people are in worse situations be grateful.

But I'm not allowed to snap, I'm not allowed to defend myself, I'm not allowed to call people out when they make me feel like I've literally gone through nothing.

I have no friends, and the people I know don't know my position. Because they literally don't give a sh*T

Im social whenever I can and this was my actual fear losing my eye sight. I'm not afraid of risking it, making hard decisions, animals, crisis. My fear is actually coming true..

How am I not going to feel depressed, sad, upset, angry, frustrated....

HOW?! I literally use the keyboard voice option instead of writing and Google assistant.

Everything I liked reading books, watching old movies, going to cons...

And the worse part is my son hides from me every time he gets because he already knows mommy can't see, so I freak out when I can't hear him or feel him in the house.

I'm just going to end it here, cuz me getting upset also makes my head hurt more than usual.",imnotscaredyouare,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe1tja/ive_been_having_chronic_pain_and_im_partially/

i finally went to my doctor in january and she gave me a referral to a psychiatrist, but wait lists here are long and its been over a month and i havent heard anything. ill probably be waiting much longer and that thought feels like torture and makes me feel worse.
im self harming, but i personally dont think its at an alarming level. there was about a month long period when i was **actively** suicidal, had a plan, a date, and the tool to do it. obviously i didnt follow through. the thought of suicide still lingers in my mind but its more low-key now...
when i was actively suicidal i was considering voluntary hospitalization. i know that route would get me treatment much quicker.
right now i feel like thats my only option with my current situation... i dont know if this is selfish, but i cant bare the thought of waiting much longer for treatment when ive been having on and off depressive episodes my whole life, and i believe im in the middle of my worst one yet right now.

In a pickle of feelings,"I've been in a very relaxed relationship since September but ever since january things have been ""on the wall."" During winter break, especially after the holidays, she became a lil bit distant to me. We eventually talked and she wanted to be apart for awhile due to personal issues with herself and I understood and we went from a relationship to just best friends. We have talked about her issues before so I told her I will always be there for her and she insisted she didnt want things to change or grow apart. We were in a very adult relationship so I didn't want to ruin or friendship, we eventually became close and things were all the same as they were before we broke up. Lately though she has been going through things again and I am having a hard time getting through it this time. Last time I took it very mature and was actually the only relationship I have actually not completely fallen apart after the break up. This time I'm thinking it's just me though and my own low self esteem has caused issues more than anything. I barely get a text from her and we never get to hang out and it really hurts, more than anything I have every felt before. This has resulted in me doing things I have never done before that I feel ashamed of, caused me to take up nicotine again, and major other issues resulting in my school work in college to be a burden rather than something to help me. Sorry I just needed to get some stuff off my chest and things and I hope she never sees any of this. She is an absolute gem and I want to be the one to be there for her as much as I can but I feel like she is hiding from me at times and doesnt want to even deal with me anymore. The only part that give me hope and joy is when I see her in class and we talk and joke, and then I kiss her good bye and I dont see her for another few days.

I and the few people that know about her problems have tried to help her and it helped a little but got bad again. She was one of my bestfriends but she makes me depressed and anxious now and I can’t handel it. But none of the people that she has told can really help her anymore because we are too exhausted and can’t risk our own health. She won’t get professional help and 70% of what she talks about is her bad eating habits or selfharm/depression.

She’s always too close to me and I have said to her that I need my personal space but she doesn’t seem to understand. I want to help her but It’s just too much right now. When we talked about her needing professional help she said that she got professional help but it got too busy just before she could get better. She ment me, I was the ”professional” help. I have been busy so I haven’t talked to her outside of school that much and I just feel like she tried to make me feel bad that she almost got better and then I got busy. Like I can’t use all my free time on you, I have my own problems and life too. She doesn’t respect my boundaries and I feel like she has gotten between me and my bestfriends. I feel like I’m a bad friend but I have to choose my health first. I need some space from her but I can’t get any. I need advice! But remember, if you are depressed please get help and talk to someone, it truly helps. This is why professional help is so good, friends can help to some extent but they aren’t professionals that know how to handel these things in the best way. I just have it hard because I’m still healing and it’s not good for me right now personally.

Feeling below average,"This feeling comes and goes and I usually keep it suppressed by submerging myself in mundane stuff. I am 34 years old and I have been dealing with these episodes of worthlessness since probably middle school. I grew up in a small rural town in Puerto Rico. I can’t say we all know each other, but everyone knows everyone else’s business. 

I  grew up in a  strict pentecostal family with many rules forced into my siblings and I. We used to go to church usually 7 days a week and on Sundays twice (Bible school in the morning and afternoon/evening service).  Secular music was prohibited and any tv material that was deemed “demonic” by the pastor. 

Of course, living in a pentecostal family made a huge impact on who I was from elementary school all the way until I decided to part ways with the faith later on in my 20s. I was so insecure about myself and tried super hard to fit in with the other kids. It was a challenge because I never felt understood by the others, mainly because I had nothing to relate with them. I was not allowed to listen to secular music or even go to the movies because of rules my mom enforced on all of us. 

That insecurity grew even stronger when entered high school, which of course was the worse years of my teenage years. There were so many things happening in my life at that moment that I thought in some weird way it was all normal. 

During the last years of elementary school my dad decided to distance himself from church. He became an alcoholic shortly after and everything went downhill from there. He multiple affairs that my mom was ware of and that didn’t turned out well for me. My mom became aggressive and depressed. I used to get hit for no reason that I can remember to this day.

I think she felt trapped because divorcing my father was not an option due to her fanaticism. My mom used to break stuff every day, scream and yell, stayed inside her room all day and praying for the most part. One positive thing I can say about her is that we were never hungry and somehow she always found ways to provide us with clothes and food. 

My dad disappeared for many months one time and I thought he gave up on us but specially on me. I felt so betrayed by him. My mom was also non-present in my life or school. My grades dropped drastically and I was bullied a lot at school for being alone the majority of the time. 

There is so much to say about everything that happened but, I thought I was over that and everything that happened. Today I am angry at my parents because how irresponsible they were with their kids. I compare myself to every one else around me and I feel like I should’ve had a better upbringing. I know it’s up to me know and they are no longer responsible but it still hurts me so much. 

I deal with my insecurities every day and that is something I’m never gonna be able to change. I compare myself a lot with everyone.  I tend to feel like a way lesser version of whoever I am comparing myself to. I’m going to therapy and that helps to a degree. I just wish I could find people or at least someone that can relate to this.

Words used to come naturally 
And now they feel dead.

I don’t know where my life is going and I don’t know why I am here. Things seem to be spinning out of control and I just don’t know how to stop things from moving. I got fired from my job for being sick, for being chronically ill. I’m doing the best I can, and being sick never effected my work performance. I belong in a hospital — but not as a patient. I am supposed to be a nurse now—I am 24. I was dead set on nursing school from the time I was a little girl. I’m supposed to be making little kids laugh as chemo flows into their veins. But no. I have a port a cath myself and nursing school seems so far away. I don’t know what I am doing. I don’t know what is going on in my relationship ship. I don’t know what is going on with my body. I go to the Mayo Clinic in two weeks so they can see what the fuck is wrong with me. I just feel like I have no control and I don’t know which way to turn. I’m trying my hardest to get through. I feel like I have no direction. Next week I don’t have any work lined up and then the week after I go to mayo. Alone. And I am starting to freak out. I mean I have traveled alone before, many times. But this is different. I am going to be poked and prodded and scanned and all of these things and I’m scared. And I will be alone. My boyfriend, who lives with me, but am now in an open relationship with and he came out as bisexual recently and we are slowly drifting apart so he can see what living life as a bi/gay man is like, will experience what it is like to be alone.

Turning 31 soon...is it worth trying to make something of myself?,"I'm almost 31 and a nurse. I own my own home in a capital city in Australia and have roughly 2/3 of the mortgage paid off. Despite these successes, I feel like a failure. I've pretty much lived my whole adult life in a way that is completely inauthentic to how I really feel inside. It's like I haven't let myself free in any way.

I always wanted to be a translator of Japanese, but I chose nursing because it was much more stable and I lacked confidence. In my early 20s I had an ED and I let guys use me for sex (I've only slept with 4 people but looking back I don't think I wanted to sleep with any of them). I used to have a nice slim figure but I've put on a few pounds from binge eating (not fat) and I'm working on losing it. I have pretty much no friends and don't really socialise outside work. I can't drive. I haven't had sex since I was 24. I've never had what you would call a proper, grown-up relationship.

I am thinking about learning a language in the hopes of changing career, but I feel like a total loser. Being 31, I feel like I'm 'over the hill' and there's no chance for me to become proficient in a skill or to succeed. I feel like no-one cares what I do, I could literally just live in my house with my cats getting fatter and fatter until I died. I seem to be obsessing over a guy who used me pretty badly at university who got married to a ballet dancer recently. I keep thinking, there's a quality woman, she's so talented, I'll never be talented like that. What's the point?

Basically I am in an anxious spiral...can anyone snap me out of this depressed thinking? I know I sound really pathetic and self-pitying, and that's because I am.",tokyospirit89,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdx6qy/turning_31_soonis_it_worth_trying_to_make/
wish someone would bring me chinese food and stroke my hair while i cry,"i am feeling very, very bad right now. suicidal i guess. more like passively wishing i would slip into death with no effort or suffering on my part. i’ve suffered enough. 

i feel like right now is the first time all week my brain has had to pause and process or actually feel something and it’s just aggressively hitting me with all the depression i’ve been stuffing down throughout the week when i didn’t have time for it. well, now i do. so here it is. 

i tried journaling. i ended up just listing ways i could kill myself right now while i’m home alone. (not gonna. wish i would, or could, but i won’t. not now). tried meditating. couldn’t focus on it or let the calm penetrate the surface. i looked at my dog and immediately started sobbing, thinking about him living without me. 

i wanted to get some fresh air and let him run around, so i let him outside and sat on the front steps. he ended up sitting right next to me. wouldn’t leave my side. i looked up and saw the moon (it was still daylight) and began crying again. my dog kept nudging me to keep a hand on him and pushing against me. it made me cry more. i talked aloud to the moon. to whatever is out there. to my late mom. begged whoever was listening to please just help me. ease the pain. do something. i do not want to do this anymore. 

sat there for a while and watched the moon move in the sky behind the bare tree branches. felt the cold air seep down to my bones. it felt good. felt good to feel something that wasn’t sadness. it calmed me down. at this point i just feel numb. back to autopilot, i guess. better than life-shatteringly sad, right? 

i wish i could tell someone “i’m feeling suicidal” and they’d drop everything to bring me chinese food and rub my back. without me saying another word. that’s what i want. ridiculous, right? but instead i tell people that and then push them away. or i don’t tell them at all. or i give subtle hints and they are completely ignored. 

actually, i wish the aid of other people would help me at all. i THINK having someone support me in this way or love me or kiss my wounds would fix it all, but it wouldn’t. i’m just terrified of the thought of dealing with this alone for another single second. i am terrified of myself. of my brain. of my sickness. my trauma. my darkness. i want someone else to come pick up all the pieces and feed me chinese food and rub my back while they do it. 

if only.

Was I depressed?,"In 2014, I first entered university and encountered a lot of changes: new people, new environment, new classes, and so on.

At the time, I had a lot of acne, which prevented me from meeting people. Furthermore, I had an identity crisis and started asking fundamental questions of life such as: ""who am I? why am I here? where do I go?"", and constantly thought about life and death. I wanted to harm myself and other people because I was in such a lonely, miserable spot when everyone else looked so happy. This lasted a few months. 

In between, I picked up lifting weights, practiced meditation, and my acne cleared up. 

Fast forward 5 years, I am completely happy. I have good friends, a good relationship with my family, and I have a stable career. Since my environment improved, my negative thoughts subsided. But I know that depressions don't go away with time, and that's what I'm worried about.

Depression and the people who treat it,"I have to get this off my chest or I’m going to go off on someone. So as you can read back through my posts, I was doing Spravato for a very short time before my insurance pulled the rug out from me. Two weeks into it, that’s right - TWO WEEKS, Insurance comes back after pre-approving my treatment and says since I had not shown a 50% improvement they were denying any further treatments. Thanks for the warning fuckers! So of course my depression and anxiety dropped severely after this happened. Partly because of being pissed and irate and outright shocked about how they could even do this. And second, my body and mind didn’t care for how I just suddenly stopped treatments. So I’ve been on a downward spiral for about two weeks now. 
Well the clinic where I was having the treatments has not really got back to me and kind of dropped me like a bad habit now that they aren’t getting money from my insurance. When the lady called to tell me she said she would talk to the dr in charge of the program and ask him what he wanted to do. That was almost two weeks ago. I’ve spoke to her once since and tried calling several times with no call back. Like seriously ... What the fuck? You have someone who was telling you I was severely depressed and suicidal (enough to get approved for disability - which is not easy to do!) and you’re just gonna fucking ignore my calls and my concerns and let me go to the wayside? What happened to checking with the dr to ask him about a next step? Is that it? Is it just like - well no more Spravato for you so we are done dealing with you?! I’m fed the fuck up quite honestly. And after waiting all week since talking to her Monday, I’m going to call tomorrow and I’m asking to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge of that fucking place. Let me just add also that when I first contacted them to set up my initial appointment, it took almost two months before I got in there! That’s right! Two months! It was the beginning of December when I first called and someone was supposed to call me back and I waited and waited and finally called and went off asking them “do I have to say I’m suicidal before someone will take me seriously and call me back??” It was soon after I finally got in there but to me that’s a little ridiculous to think of making a suicidal person wait almost two months to start treatment or be evaluated. 
Between that and the insurance screwing me, I’m truly and utterly fed up. It makes me sick and pissed off how the system fails people like me and then they wonder why mental illness is such an issue and has such a stigma around it! Well no fucking wonder. If others are treated anything like I have been, and I have a feeling that many are, then I can see why people lose their shit and either end up killing them selves or others. Let me clarify - I’m NOT in any way condoning that behavior or saying it’s okay. I’m simply saying that it’s no wonder there’s such an issue with mental illness in this county. 
All that being said, where does one go from here? I’ve tried therapists, countless medicines, obviously the Spravato - all to come to this. To pretty much be treated as if my life means nothing and completely and utterly ignored! I hate to sound narcissistic, but god damn. My life should be just as important as anyone else’s. 
Here’s the conclusion I’ve pretty much come to in the last 24 hours. I have to stop depending on anyone to help me deal with this fucking sickness. I have to depend on myself to somehow get better. I am the only one who is here for me. Nobody else gives a fuck. Nobody. Why should they? They have nothing invested in me and I mean nothing. If they aren’t getting money from insurance then why bother even returning my phone call right? 
I don’t know. If this is what our society has come to, I seriously want no part of it anymore. It’s disgusting and I am to the point where I hate people in general. I know that sounds bad, but go back up and re-read my post if you really want to try to understand why I am starting to hate people. I wasn’t always this way. Yes, I’ve dealt with mental illness most my life in some capacity or another. But here in the last 5 years it has hit the absolute bottom of the bottom. I look back at times when I thought I was depressed before and I think to myself - I’d give anything to go back to that time and redo things. 
I don’t really have anything else to say. I’ve rambled on enough. I just had to get this all out in some way. If you made it to this and have read my whole post then thank you. You’ve shown more concern than the people who claimed to be there for me and deal with my depression - until the insurance money stopped coming.",fairysparkles333,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe6svr/depression_and_the_people_who_treat_it/
Does anyone else feel alone even when surrounded by people?,"Things that didn't bother me in the past are now sending me into a deep depression.

Thats happening to me constantly lately. I guess it always did but I didnt think about it so hard in the past. Now it just makes me feel so alone. I can be talking and bubbly and I mention an interest and the person i'm talking to just nods in feign interest. If its over text its just stuff like ""wow"",  ""nice"",  ""lol"",  ""cool"". You can just tell they arent interested because as soon as the topic changes they are so much more involved. Honestly its making me feel so bitter, it feels like no one cares enough to try and get involved with the interests which mean the most to me. I can be surrounded by people but I feel so alone because I know no one cares. I know no one cares about me. No one cares about my interests. Honestly its just gotten really sad. Out of context this can sound so selfish but I just compare it to myself - when I know someone I love is deeply interested in something I try my hardest to see what they see when they look at it.

Can't Trust My Girrlfriend When I'm Depressed,"Hello all, 

Using a throwaway account, but I frequent this sub on my main account. Anyway, I need some advice. I can't trust my girlfriend when I'm depressed. The both of us deal with anxiety and depression, but she doesnt seem to get me when I'm depressed. Don't get me wrong, we both have our faults, but we always do our best to understand each other and walk through hard times with one another. However,  the last two times that I have been very depressed, she ended up pushing me away when I needed her the most. About a month ago she got very upset with me that she walked over to me and angrily accused me of not showing enough attention to our relationship. I had a family member pass just a few weeks before, and I think it was finally getting to me. I apologized, told her that I'm depressed, saying that I wish I could be doing better. I told her that I was depressed and she walked away, angry, slamming the door behind her. The person that I love the most turned her back on me when I needed her the most. I went for a walk, we messaged each other, and she asked me to come back. She was crying so much, I felt bad. She felt terrible for not listening to me. This wasn't the first time that something like this has happened though. When I am depressed, she pushes me away. Besides this, my girlfriend is incredibly loving, thoughtful, creative in our relationship, and sacrifices so much for us. But this, this hurts so fucking bad.

"I was dead years ago, I'm just catching up","I give up.  I have been over life since I was a teenager and I'm not doing a good enough job hiding it anymore.  My boss even pulled me aside with concerns. 


""When I was interviewing you you had the best interview I'd ever seen. Where is that guy? You miss work, you're emotional, you have lost all your passion"" 

My mother can't even talk to me without me going into tears over being the worst son ever. She hasn't said anything to that effect but does notes that I'm not eating. Not doing anything anymore. When I'm off work I end up spending hours just staring at the walls and I'll find myself crying although I don't know what for. She doesn't visit my home as often anymore.

I feel like I'm starting to slip and it's too much. When I could hide it it was fine because I didn't have to explain anything to anyone, but having people ask me directly why I'm malnourished and lost a lot of weight is leading to outbursts I can't control anymore.  

I was keeping it together pretty well for about 30 years but in the last 2 years my entire friend groupEnded up moving away or finding their own lives all at about the same timeAnd since then I've not really had any contact With other people outside of work 
. I'm glad I was able to keep it together until everyone found their own happiness so I avoided being a burden to them. so I feel like it's as good a time as any to have me just quietly disappear
 I don't know how to tell everybody that the guy that they thought they knew was an act and never existed in the 1st place. I feel darker and darker thoughts more and more often lately and I would honestly be terrified to actually hurt somebody else. And I guess I just wish that there was some safe in easy way out of life because I don't really deserve it.

Identity and being suicidal,"My problem started about 4 years ago.  Generally, I am a calm person - an introvert (more ambivalent), I liked being with myself, I liked to help, I was quite specific, very empathetic, although I stayed with other normal cool people.  I couldn't be a dick.
 Over time, I noticed that I stand out.  Others went somewhere, spent time, etc. Problems started in high school when it came to partying, crazy outings.  Everyone snapped, told their exits as if it was unknown.  And I didn't have anyone but one friend.  I found that something was wrong with me and I began to change.  I wanted to reprogram, upload other more extroverted software.  At that time I had a completely distorted picture of reality.  And for example - I have always been balanced and did not make quick, ill-considered decisions.  Seeing that others don't do it, I suppressed it and added it to my new ""software"".  Seeing that others do not respond immediately to the huts also so began to do.  These small, seemingly low risk examples have changed me.  There were plenty of them.  I did so with everything.  I know it's sick but it was so.  I began to think what other people's lives were like.  I wanted to experience these beautiful moments that I heard and told them myself.  It lasted a long time.  My current personality was changed.  I copied every behavior and thinking patterns of the ""better"" ones I took an example of. After half a year, I got depressed. I felt terrible. Memory loss, pits. I realized what I had done and wanted to unprogram. I began to think, I analyzed my personality a lot  , what should change, how to behave and feel. I tried to remember my previous identity. I had so many copied habits that I didn't know how to behave, feel, think. I didn't feel like myself, as if unreal, in a dream, without contact  with feelings, emotions.
 The situation continues to this day.  I do not know who I am.  I don't feel anything, I don't feel myself.
 The only thing keeping me alive is the awareness that it used to be good and it's all in my head.  I often have thoughts of suicide.
 I have sick thoughts - I classify people according to their qualities that are useful and not, I divide people into better and worse.  I do not feel anything.
 Not once during these 4 years did I feel alive.  No sadness, no shot of joy, no intense feeling.
 He constantly compares himself to others.  I do not know how to be myself - I look at others, I wonder what they feel, how they think, what chances I would face against them.  The psychologist and therapy did nothing.  Now he keeps in touch with a psychologist who tells me to stop thinking and follow my feelings
 I try to do it but I still want to write it.  I feel lost.  The only thing keeping me alive is reason.  Nothing else.  He tells me he thinks it all.  I don't remember what it's like to be happy.  I do not know who I am.

Beauty and the Beast but I'm the Beast?,"My partner is the most happy, positive, loving person in the world. I have never met anyone like him, he's so special and he makes me feel things I've never felt before. But it kills me how much shit I put him through all the time. He sees me when I'm depressed and it hurts him, and I lash out on him because I'm not feeling well and I have mood swings. And somehow it bothers me even more that he doesn't mind, he doesn't get offended or angry, I could be absolutely horrible to him and he would just show me endless love and try to comfort me and reassure me he's where he wants to be.

I know I should be happy, but it bothers me so much. I'm constantly tormented by feeling like an awful person for doing mean things to someone so amazing. A little voice in my head never stops telling me he deserves better and I would be doing him a favour if I broke up with him. Yeah, he would be hurt for a little while, but he'd get over me and then he could find someone who treats him the way he should be treated. I wish I could treat him right but I feel like I have no control over my mood swings.

There's also a selfish part of me that thinks I would feel better if I broke up with him and didn't have to feel so guilty all the time. I feel like I'm going to end up ruining him, he's so positive and he brightens up every room he's in, but what if my sadness rubs off on him? I'd be hurt too if we split up but I deserve that, he doesn't deserve a monster like me.

I have to let him go.,"Our relationship was the best up until the 19th of February. I let my insecurities, fears and depression get me and I overwhelmed him. I drove him away and now it feels like we dont know each other. all our conversations are one sided. I haven't seen him for weeks except for the two times I asked to talk to him. I'm in a worse state and the only way I can win him back is to get stronger but I cant. every day I come home, lay on my bed, stare at the wall, cry and remember this all my fault. He's a good person and he doesn't deserve someone ruining his happiness. today I'm preparing myself to let him go. I love him with all my heart but I cant stand it anymore. I want to get stronger but I just cant. All my friends dont know about it because I dont want to overwhelm them like how I did with him. Again, I felt alone. And I hated it. Why couldnt I be happy like 2 months ago? Why did this sadness come back? This is much stronger than what I felt for the past 11 years. Buy when the day comes where we part.

Went to a psychiatrist,"This morning my mom took me to a psychiatrist appointment I’ve been waiting for for months. Immediately, he began questioning why I was there when I had good grades in school and seemed fine. Also asked if I was restless all the time and I said yes, and he told me no I wasn’t because I wasn’t fidgeting at that point (even though I was shaking and playing with my Kleenex) Then my mom mentioned the eating disorder clinic I’ve been going to and he asked my bmi and I’m not allowed to know it, so he made me stand up and started patting me down to get a “feel for my weight”. By this point I was crying and he just continued to make me feel like I was faking it or shouldn’t be there. It took me 6 years to speak up about this and now I’m regretting it because I always feared I would be told that I was overreacting or faking it. Was uncomfortable the whole time too because he was sitting with like less than a metre between us and. I have to go see him again in a few weeks and I’m so terrified, I’m still crying and it’s been 3 hours.

Do I even want help?,"I reached out yesterday... I called 111. I needed to. But now, am I glad I did or do I regret it?

 Depression at varying degrees has been my state of existence for so long, I don't know who I am without it. Yes, I have good times that are not as bad... But they are short-lived. Fleeting.

I last had medical help a few years ago. Therapy and meds helped. Therapy ended... Then I missed an appointment for a med check and I don't reschedule when that happens... I don't want to waste anyone's time.

My state was tolerable. Manageable. I stopped self harming more than a year and a half ago. I'm proud of that, even if that long stretch came from a bad relapse... I don't want to ruin it now. I really don't.

The thing is, my mental state has been deteriorating over the past few months... Year? More? I don't even know... Occasional thoughts of hurting myself I can ignore and move on from. But they, like the happy times, are usually fleeting. As are worse thoughts. Now... It's persistent. And fighting it is exhausting. Reached a point yesterday where I honestly did not feel safe. So I called. 111 put me onto the rapid response team. Had a meeting today. Have a doctor's appointment tomorrow. Have to see them ever day for a little under two weeks.

But that doesn't stop the thoughts... I feel guilty because I feel like I'm taking valuable resources away from someone else who needs them. But I'm also worried... I lose chunks of time... My memory is crap and I can forget things minutes later sometimes (it's intermittent)... I have no energy or drive to do... Anything... I can't focus on conversations and constantly have to ask people to repeat themselves. I've been getting persistent chest pains and my vision is just... Weird. I can't explain completely. And I'm constantly fighting the need to do... Something. I need to hurt. But I can't let myself. And it's exhausting.

So all these strategies coming in and I keep asking myself... I don't even want help. Or do I? I don't know. I know I reached out and I know I can't keep doing this without professional help. My SO also can't keep up with this... He isn't a professional and it's so unfair to him. I want to be better for him as well as... I just want to be normal... To function. But all this outside help. It feels like too much, too fast... It would be easier to just... Not...

I've finally accepted that I'm a fucking failure.,"I'm at my 3rd job in my field out of grad. The first lasted 3 months before they told me it wasn't working out, the second lasted 7 months before they told me I was slipping, and this one just ended today with a phone call at a mere 2 months. I don't know if I can make myself go on. I don't know where else to go, my skills weren't good enough, and it was a specialized field. I was too quiet for something too client-oriented and it translated to having terrible communication skills that I can't get over. My peers are all going to hear about this, it's a small field and you tend to see everyone in the same industry at conferences, two of them worked at that first job and are heavy gossipers and they'll probably tell everyone there what happened and they'll feel that happy schadenfreude that I was a fucking failure, another piece of conversation fodder to laugh about. I have my other classmates on social media and they post about how great it is to be in that field, and some of them share the same interests as I do so I'll likely run into them again at fan-related events. They say that you shouldn't care about what other people think but easier said than done. I can't face them again and I can't face myself either.

My dog just pulled me out of a funk,"Hi guys. I've been struggling with a relapse into severe depression for the last couple of months. I've been seeing a psychiatrist who has changed me onto new meds, and I'm slowly starting to come good, but the last couple of days I've been in a deep funk, just not interested in doing anything, not eating, barely talking. I've spent most of my time in bed, or watching youtube, or both. I don't know if it's the change in meds (probably) or what, but I wanted to share a ridiculous moment I just had. 

My dog (a 5yo kelpie named Max) walked into my room, and nudged his butt against my knee like he does when he wants pats. I wasn't feeling it, and nudged him away. He came back, sat down on my foot, and let rip with a huge fart. Right on my foot. I started laughing - I haven't laughed in the last couple of days - and I kept laughing for a solid five minutes. I opened the window to clear the air (also haven't opened the window in the last couple of days) and all of a sudden the funk was over. It was like he poured cold water over my head and my vision cleared. I'm sitting at my desk in the fresh air, still smiling, and about to start on some uni work I have to get a jump on.  Max is napping on my bed like the champion he is.

Things can be so dark for so long that it can be hard to imagine anything different. I don't know what your version of your dog farting on your foot is, but when it comes, try to let it pull you out of the funk.

Totally burned out and extrem depressed,"So im going to tell you a „little“ about my Situation. I am usually a pretty happy Person. I like doing fun Things like going out with Friends who ive known pretty much all my life (im 23 ) and i have a passion which Is Film making. But Since i started with school even at a Young age i always had Problems concentrating and focusing at School it just isnt for me because I don’t see the benefits from it. I also think the school system is extremly outdated. Last September I started my education ( I live in Germany and the English word for ausbildung translates to education.. ) I work in a world known firm which im not going to name because of a couple of reasons which aren’t related to my problem though. I would say it’s pretty fun because all of my co workers and bosses are pretty nice and always want me to succeed and do good. I’m also pretty good at this job. Even though I got a lot for me going in this particular job I don’t really see me self working in this job for the rest of my life. I’d rather make a living doing films. But I could imagine working for a few years while working for my dream and that’s not a problem. But school is a major problem for me (in Germany you have to go to school while being in Vocational training, another word for the German word Ausbildung) it’s not that easy and I am literally crying everyday that I come from school ( School is 2 times a week ) I can’t concentrate well in school and I miss a lot of school material while trying to focus on a topic. When I have to write an exam I become depressed as f*ck from Studying. Everytime I Imagine working or having school I have suicidal thoughts and can’t get out of my bed for days sometimes. These thoughts are sometimes so bad, I imagine myself to end it all.. I also have a girlfriend which is my biggest supporter and the best human you could ever imagine. She gives everything trying to cheer me up and help me with my problems while working a 9 to 5 job. We want to marry and this is why I even got this job. Because of cultural reasons her family won’t let her get married unless her future husband gets a “secured” Vocational training in case something happens in life that I have something to fall back on. Me and her have the same outlook on this “cultured” living, it’s f*ckin stupid. I can understand her parents as well but it’s just that I am at a totally burned out point in my life that I can’t get motivated to finish this all.

"Days Like Today are the Days I wonder what the point is to carry on... :,(","I didn't sleep for shit again last night. Since I started taking Cymbalta, I have been having insomnia, even when I take melatonin. I miss sleep so much. Restful sleep... and my sex drive... thats just fucking gone. 

Work sucked so much today. One of the managers has an axe to grind with me it seems like and questioned what I was doing. I have been working for this company for almost four years and I know what I am doing. Then when I answered him he went and followed up with the other person to make sure I was telling the truth. I have never been dishonest with anyone at work so that really pissed me off and hurt my feelings. I am so tired of not being trusted. I once got accused of stealing $5k at a credit union I worked at long ago. I was never charged because I didn't do it and they couldn't prove it. I didn't do it and I don't know if they ever found out who did but it caused me a lot of hurt and grief. It is one of the worst feelings having everyone think you are something, like a theif, when you are far from it. I am still trying to lose that 50 pounds I gained from that bout of depression. I think my managers bullshit today stirred that shit up. 

I am simply exisiting today. I hurt everywhere. I dont feel like there really is any point to life anymore. I havent been happy for a long time. Ive tried medication. Ive been staying active om top of my already incredibly phyiscal job (i work in a warehouse). I dont have many friends anymore... my family is super negative.... im very much just going through the  motions and i ak so tired of it.

Maybe its for the best that I don't live anymore,"I am almost 40, on disability morbidly obese and can't lose weight no matter how hard I try.   I am almost 40, with nothing but a 500 dollar laptop that my neighbor gave me that is falling apart and only worth around 70 if that. a pair of shoes that are falling apart and hurt when I walk in them. about a dozen worn-out socks and a few shirts and pants all black. mostly sweat pants and two pairs of blue jeans and a worn-out wallet that is falling apart on me. 

I am on disability getting less than 800$ USD a month and have no educational background no GED was homeless for over 8 years and have bad teeth because of it. some need fixing and one needs a new crown. I wasn't taught dental hygiene until I became homeless and even then brushing and flossing was the least of my worries. it was more of getting food and trying to survive. 

I spent the past few years trying to get my GED and failed even with tutors and teachers and study groups found out I have learning issues that make it hard for me to get my GED and I basically have to go from the 2nd and 3rd grade to 12th grade in every subject.

I have no family, no friends. I am utterly alone in this world. Bought a car two years ago was my first car and was planning on living in it but got scammed out of 3k. been trying to save again for another car to live in but been unable to. 

Renting a bedroom from an elderly woman with bad health and she is going in for surgery today if she doesn't make it I will be homeless again nowhere to live and unable to survive being homeless this time. My body has arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there's days that I just can't get out of bed because of it hurting so badly. there is no way I can survive being on the streets again.

I feel like complete and utter crap especially compared to everyone else and now realizing how worthless I am in life and maybe it is for the best I just don't live anymore. I have nothing in this world to live for other than myself and even then I don't care to do that anymore. nothing in my life will get better. 

I applied for HUD housing and was supposed to move into my own apartment after 7 years of waiting on the list for over 40 hud housing I got accepted to one but I couldn't make it there as I had no money to get there or for first months rent, downpayment, or to have the lights turned on. 

I spent the past ten years trying to better my life but only to get knocked down every time I get up. For example. saved 3 to 4 years up to 3k and bought my first car then got scammed by the dealership. Resaved money up to 900 dollars then needed two teeth pulled which cost 450 each after tax which drained my 900 I had saved last month after almost a year of saving. Then I got called up for my first apartment ever and couldn't get there. 

Two years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. 

Spent years trying to get my GED only to fail it every time I try. spent the past eight years in the dating scene only to get rejected by women over my weight and told I am worthless and have nothing to offer a relationship or just downright mocked at and laughed at over my weight.

I got the cataracts in my eyes from taking Androgel testosterone medication because I have very low testosterone and I am on thyroid meds because my thyroid is basically dead and when they gave the max dose I lost 45 lbs in 8 months with absolutely no changes to my diet or daily routine but then gained it back a year later..

I just literally can't take anymore of this crummy life and to the point of thinking death is a lot better than this and it is better to be dead than keep failing or being knocked down every time I try to do something with my life. 

I also suffer from CPTSD = Complex post traumatic Stress Disorder. I didn't serve just from things I been through in my life and childhood. I also suffer from Severe chronic depression, Severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia and learning issues. I have been diagnosed with them all. 

I have looked up issues with autism and self diagnosing that I may be borderline autistic as I have some of the same issues in that spectrum.

Please be mindful,"Please be mindful when commenting on posts. This applies to me, maybe it applies to others, maybe it doesn't.

I'm not here looking for someone to fix my problems. It wouldn't be possible. It would take a novel to give all of the context, the background, the struggles, the attempts, the life. I'm here for comfort. To know that I'm not alone. To be able to express my anguish in whatever means I choose without fear of judgment and negativity. It is not helpful to trivialize my problems. I understand that we all want to solve these issues. That we don't want to see others suffering. Giving solutions to problems you do not understand is not helpful. Giving advice to someone that does not ask for it is not helpful. My problems will not be solved by a paragraph comment. However, I find comfort in knowing that I'm not alone. That comfort helps me cope, helps me push on, helps me make it through another day. That's why I am here. I really appreciate this place.

And during this time last year it was the same thing but it lasted nearly 6 months before i started to feel okay. But i know that depression can make you unproductive and drop your grades, but my grades in school are still really good (its still hard to concentrate in class i just understand subjects on my own) and i do daily tasks like showering and cleaning.

* No self worth
* Always miserable

What is best to say (or not say) when someone is self deprecating?,"What kind of feedback (or perhaps lack of) are best when someone is self deprecating? To disagree, to give alternatives, to change subjects?
I don't hope to invalidate a feeling or pretend like it isn't significant or impactful.

I recognize this ought to vary with each person and each scenario, though I wonder about responses that have made things better, easier, made you feel understood, or responses that were absolutely unhelpful.

Many times, it feels proper to simply be there with/for the person when this is happening, but when it is time to say something it is challenging to gauge what is best to say.",braidedcarpet,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe5nbf/what_is_best_to_say_or_not_say_when_someone_is/

35(F) suffer from clinical depression. I feel trapped in my 9 year relationship.,"Hi, I wasn't sure where to post this since it relates to a relationship. I've dealt with depression since my early teen's. It continued to be a major problem in my life until about my mid 20s when I met my current partner. Because of how emotionally mature, supportive and trusting he was, I felt my espisodes we not as frequent or as severe. However as I began to hit my 30s, I started to notice the larger issues that I overlooked when I was younger as not important, like his finanical health (how he views money/saving). He holds a job with little responsibility and low-stress but pays as such (i.e. near minimum wage). He did work overtime for a time to afford a house, which he has but needs me to pay half the mortgage in order to afford it. He says I'm the love of his life but he's not interested in getting married. He's also almost nearly a decade older than me.

I feel trapped because as much as I love him, I want to leave. The major reasons I want to leave are different views towards finances, marriage and moving (he doesn't want to move away from where his parents live). I've been wanting to leave for a very long time but I'm also scared. This decision has caused my anxiety then depression to spring up full force, comptemplating suicide because I'd rather die than live on my own. I haven't lived on my own since my early 20s and every time I lived alone it would result in me being suicidal nearly every day. I struggled, graduated late in college and managed a business degree that did nothing, but earn me an unstable job history and act as a cover to people that I'm doing okay. I just realize how emotionally dependent I am on him and that scares me too. I have no family or friends to talk to about this or for any emotional support. I also hate the state I live in as there are many bad memories here of past abuse. My parents also live here and our relationship remains strained.

What I want is to move out of this city and start over but I don't know if that's my depression talking or what. I don't trust my own decisions or judgements. I have low esteem for myself and my choices. Back to the reasons for leaving my partner though---I feel like who am I to say what I want in a relationship since for instance, I can't even hold a steady job so again, makes it hard to leave him. I'm also currently in school again to once more try a job more suitable to my personality--massage. Until then, I'm stuck living with him for another 6 months.

How do you find the courage to live on your own? Past that, how do you find the will or care to live? I don't have anyone. I mean, I won't have anyone if I leave him and that scares me into staying with him too. Or should I just stay with him and work things out? I'm not sure. I just know I can't sleep well, don't eat much and been crying every other day. Sometimes I just would rather die than have to make a life decision...

I’m losing myself.,"I can’t keep going.

I try and try to be a good person and every time I turn around the world takes something from me. I can’t afford to live anymore. The state of the world makes me sick. My family is so splintered. I lost my dad and my mother is so beyond done dealing with my messed up self it makes my chest hurt.

I never wanted to be this. I wanted to make my family’s life better but here I am a failed 38 year old man who can’t even support himself let alone help those I love.

I don’t know where to turn. Doctors push so many drugs on me and I feel like I can not even think because of it therapy just wants me to blame my father and I do t want to do that, I loved him and he loved me. 

I hate myself and who I have become. I want a normal life. I want to support myself and help my loved ones. I was the rock and now I’m just a pile of shit.

I can’t do this. I hate it, I hate me. I do not remember a time when my chest did not hurt from this. I’m so tired. I want to love someone, I want to be better. I’m going to die like this and I can’t stand the thought.

How can I legally die? I just want to stop being the burden. People will forget me quickly, I provide nothing to this world. 

I’ve never kissed a woman. I’m a damn loser.

I can’t even imagine having a child because I would never want this to pass down to them. The thought of that makes me sick. I just want love, of any type. I just want to hold someone.

Letting go the only thing that make me happy,"I’m 30yr male, living alone, unemployed, broke, alone, and the only thing that get me going is my dream to become a filmmaker, but that dream now starting to fall apart.

Filmmaking has been literally the thing that shape who i am today. I’ve been doing videography and editing stuff for almost 10 years, beside doing my passion project, i also earn a living by edit and produce video for small businesses. Overtime I learned alot about the entertainment industry, but i never part of them. Instead i just do my freelance work, but i do have a dream, to make a feature film. Knowing my own lacking, i study and research as much as i could about independent film and unfortunately in my country, indie scene is basically non existent. I decided to fund my own film, because nobody wants to finance a stranger like me. 

Earlier this year, I thought this year will be the year I finally made it. I sold my car and use my saving to fund a film project which i hope can be the one that gets people attention. As i slowly developing the project, i met several industry folks, with the intention of gaining knowledge and get some support, but instead all i got is them dismissed and laughed at my project because I’m a fool to even dream about making a film with my budget, and more importantly, I’m nobody. I was treated nonchalantly. Hate to say this, but i do agree on some of the points they gave.

Now I’m aware, even if i did make the film, the chances for it to actually help me further my career is slim. I love doing this, and i would love to make a living with this, but moneys are tight, the thought of giving up the only thing i passionate the most in my life, kills me.

Today, I’m just laying hopelessly typing this crap on my phone. I lost all the passion, and motivation to keep going. I’m tired of seeing people, i spent my days at home alone. I’m embarrassed with my friends and family, especially my mom, who has been nothing but supportive.

I’m contemplating if i should let go of this dream and looking for a new job at 30yr.",ministerofterrible,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe5kou/letting_go_the_only_thing_that_make_me_happy/

Some days I feel good (better than usual, at least) and others, like today, just feels like I can't do literally anything.

Some days I think I am getting better, that I can make better habits and get myself out of this crutch.

Two Different People,"It would be nice to hear from other people what you’re experiences have been like.

When I’m on my own or with people I’m comfortable around, I’m “normal.” My version of happy and normal anyway, whatever that looks like with depression wrapped in. 

Then, when I go out in social situations, I’m someone else. I’m frantic, I try too hard to be funny, etc. I’m socially anxious, I guess that’s the point.

But I find these opposites in writing too. When I’m writing I’m intelligent, I have a lot to say and offer people. But when I speak directly to people I clam up. I have a tiny vocabulary. I swear a lot. I saw the same words/phrases over and over. None of these things is particularly bad on their own but together it translates into me being a fucking mess.

Friends are finally leaving me. My brain is fucking with me.,"This is a long text about what I'm dealing with.. just giving you a heads up.I hate embarrassing myself and I act in a way I dont like. I maybe acting in a way which balances all the embarrassments I deal with. 

I keep thinking about past moments where it's fucking embarrassing and then I hate to fight to being the person to desire to be. By embarrassing it means either people telling me on my face which hurts me and they know it but still choose to say it because they know Im boring now and I don't have the confidence they saw in me they used to. I'm on their side on this cuz I they are true. And I don't know how to help myself out of this. 

 To be honest I'm lonely like literally lonely only because of me. I'm not open about my feelings and try to just move the conversation about general things. I only love people but not give back anything or show it. Theres not a single person who I have a nice relationship with right now. I mean to say I don't have but they do. Few of my friends care about me and don't want me to get hurt but that's all. I don't like my family because I'm thinking like this just because of their conditioning . I hate my insecure mom who is highly egoistic of herself and can't handle rejection or appreciation she gets defensive for very small things and also expects me to show love to her and give the attention she needs all the time and if I don't do it she gets hurt again and gets defensive. I hate that she's like that and that's in me . That is my biggest problem because I have conversations in my head to fix her cuz I don't want her to be that way and I do this therapeutic talk all the time with her and me. Im starting to get sick of it and handle this. I know all the ways she can't get offended and it's not hard and it's my problem to deal with convincing her. I can't fucking do it I wanna leave her but I can't live with guilt she has given me till now that I can't live by knowing she's gonna get mental if I leave her. She has friends but they're cringe as fuck saying I love you or I hate you. All they talk about is that. She wants everything without deserving it. 

When I say all this about her I know that I act like her and when I say I hate her I hate the part of me that's her. That part of me is not leaving me. I try to give people guilt trips unconsciously or give them situations where I get rejected and I won't take it properly. This feeling of being alone after someone shows that they don't like me is what I want to feel but I want to say to mind that noone likes me and I'm alone. 

Today I truly feel like I don't have a friend to share any of my feelings to because it is truly cringe worthy and embarrassment because I feel like this. I have a lot of potential in me . I have great looks. Im smart. I'm talenting in coding. I'm very funny sometimes. But my ego which judges me and judges others gets all its data and fucks me over and convincing me to feel shitty and unmotivated all the time. 

I can't say these things to anyone I know and I'm always confused with the way I think I don't know what's a good thought or a bad thought because they have their own points which are opposite. Im conditioning and people are trying. To get rid of me because they don't like me anymore. I'm boring and I don't want to settle to this but I'm setting. I hate that this happening but not enough.

This is very general when I say people or feelings but this insecurity in a college environment. Everyone is different here and there only a few cool people. Every friend i know is a confident secure person and deals with Thier problems with friends together. I can't have that.

My personality is dead because of the shit thats in my head. The therapeutic talk. The polar opposite debates about feelings. Numbness. And living with the shitty version of myself. I know this is mood. In other times when I feel genuinely happy I have an answer that says just keep going through whatever it is and it's easy. It's not really easy at other times. And we don't know how long should I wait for the next mood switch to happen.",clientmein,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fduleb/friends_are_finally_leaving_me_my_brain_is/
Asshole dad doesn't support my dreams. Long rant.,"I'm 24 years old and have recently graduated from college with a BA in art. Art has been my passion since I was a little kid and I hope I can one day have an exhibition showcasing my art. 

So back in 2019 just a few months after graduating college I applied for this artists residence program. I knew that I probably wouldn't get accepted as these  residences are usually very popular and I was still buliding up my
career in art. But I still wanted to try and get more experienced in writing applications and though I'd give it a go and you never know I might just be lucky enough to be accepted. 
This particular application had to be sent in by post. So I asked my mum for a stamp. Later that day my dad sees the stamp booklet and asks what it was doing there. So my mum told him. He just conpleatly lost his shit and started yelling at my mum. He was arngry that my mum hadn't told him about my plans to apply for this residence. I could hear the yelling from my bedroom and came down to see what it was about. 

I can't remember everything that happened and what was said. But basically my dad felt that this was a terrible idea. That the residence wouldn't be good for me and that I shouldn't be moving out. 
I kept trying to explain how there were many benefits of doing this residence. And how I wouldn't be moving away forever. Besides I was 23 at the time. A lot of people my age had lived away from their parents. He, however, couldn't get his head around it. He thought the residence program wasn't legitimate. Despite the fact that I  found out about it through my college lectures and how they literally give us seminars on how to apply to these residences. 

He keep yelling and screaming causing my mum to cry and sleep in my sister's room that night. 

I didn't let the events of that night keep me from pursuing my dream. Fast forward to a few days ago and I'm working on another application for a artist residence. This one also has to be sent in by post. So this time I tell my dad what I'm doing just before he went to bed. He rolled his eyes but didn't say much. 
The next day I'm printing off my application and I can hear my dad speaking negativity about this residences to my mum.

My mum is so kind and loving and supportive of me and my dreams. I really couldn't ask more of her. 
Anyway. I come into the room and tell my dad that I can hear him talking about me. 
He says similar stuff to what he said back in 2019. How he's thinks its a bad idea. How he thinks I shouldn't be moving out. He is of the belief that I'm looking at this with rose tinted glasses. I try to explain how I'm not some stupid little kid just following some whimsical dream. This is my passion. Its the thing I have a degree in and very much plan on pursuing. 
 For some reason he cannot understand what a 
residence involves. I thought the team residence made it fairly obvious. However I try to explain how its a place you live and work in. So you can produce artwork in a proper studio. He's still just shaking his head saying its a bad idea. I ask him why he thinks its a bad idea but he just cuts me off and tells me to tell him why its a good idea.
Once again I try to explain the benefits. Because I'm just making small bits of Watercolour paintings in my bedroom and having a studio would be so much more ideal.
He stars asking questions about how they chose people. I explain about how you send in a cover letter, an artist cv, and images of your work.

For some reason he keeps referring to the residence as a course. My mum and I tell his how its not a course its a place to live and work. He doesn't seem to understand. 
He says how the only people who will benefit from this course are the people running in. 

He seems to believe that because I wouldn't be paid to attend this residence that its a waste of time. 
I'm not even asking my parents for money to fund this residence. I planned to pay the rent myself. 
The he says how I should be looking for work. He's a bit of a booomer. He seems to think that there's loads of jobs going round and I just couldn't be bothered to get one. Not true. 

I had a job not too long ago but it was temporary contract work which ended a few weeks ago. 

He has the nerve to say that when he, himself has been unemployed since the early 2000s and my mum is the main breadwinner.
 He just happens to be related to wealthy parents whom he inherited loads of money from when they died. He doesn't know the struggle of looking for work or having a strict budget. 
I asked if he'd prefer if i were in some dead end job that made me miserable. No he says. He'd like to see me in a job that makes me happy. And he sort of suggests to continue with art on the side but apparently working and doing an art residence is just too much. 

Anyway, getting back on track. He mentioned how he thinks I'm too vulnerable and not ready to move out. I don't know how he's going to react when I have enough money saved up to move out. But he can't stop me from moving out and living my own life. I haven't even been accepted by the residence program and he's acting as if I'm leaving to live on the other side of the world.
Everything up to this point has been very upsetting and stressful and depressing. But than he goes and says that I'm not good enough or talented enough. Thst these no future in this residences. No future in art. 

That fucking hurt but I highly suspected this. I told him that I already knew that. This man hasn't even seen half of my art. Hasn't see what I'm capable of doing. And doesn't understand how the art world works. If I were bad I wouldn't have gotten my BA. It's still so hard to not let his words get to me. I'm still planning on applying for open calls to residences and exhibitions. I know i have talent and I work hard. Even if I'm not currently good enough that doesn't mean I should stop. The only thing that will stop me from having a future in art is if I give up. So I won't give up until I have made it.",jenniferyoung03,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe5ixt/asshole_dad_doesnt_support_my_dreams_long_rant/

I’ve reached my breaking point-,"Okay so I have absolutely no one to talk to, so forgive me for ranting here and making little to no sense. I just really need to get things off my chest. 

I really want to die. I’ve reached the point where I would be fine with a car crashing into mine and killing me, or being shot, or getting a terminal illness; I’m not picky over how I die, I just want to vanish from Earth. And I’m too much of a coward to do it myself, though I think about it all the time. My family has grown attached to me, despite the fact that they used to hate my guts during my teenage years. I fixed my relationship with them, and I know dying would hurt them but I’m a selfish idiot. 

I recently started college and it’s awful. I used to be a great student in high school, the type of student teachers praise by saying they have a great future ahead of them. But along the way I fucked up. I feel dumber and dumber each day, I see my classmates learning quick while I struggle to understand a simple class. I can barely finish assignments on time and each day I find less reasons to finish them. I fear failing my classes, I’ve never failed one before but at the rate this is going I probably will. My family has put so many high expectations on me, and I’ve always known I would never meet them. 
I’m not even studying what I wanted because my mother disapproved of my original career choice. I wanted to study physics, but she made me study electronic engineering. 
The firsts exams were awful, I know I still have time to recover from my pitifully mediocre scores but I seriously doubt I will. 

I have no friends, my personality is awful and I never learned how to talk to people, I’m too awkward. I’m also incredibly hideous and fat, there’s nothing I like about myself. I absolutely loathe everything about myself. There’s no redeeming quality about me. I used to think I was smart but it’s clear I’m a dumb idiot that never should had been born. I wish my mother aborted me when she had the chance. I’m just a fucking waste of space. 

I can’t even cry anymore. Hell, I don’t even feel anything most of the time. I’m just numb, but sometimes I feel dread settle over me and not leave for days. I’m an useless, worthless piece of shit. I know that. I just want to disappear. I hope to fall asleep and never wake up. 
My birthday is in two days but I don’t think I can handle turning eighteen years old, I know not much will change but I can’t just keep living. Each day feels like torture, getting out of my bed takes too much of me and falling asleep is too difficult. I’m just really fucking tired all the time, no matter how much I sleep.

Feeling High on Lexapro,"[I'm not seeking any medical advice, just want to know if anyone has had similar experiences]

I've just started taking Lexapro for moderate depression and anxiety. For the first week I was prescribed 5mg, 10mg thereafter. It's been two days and I have this mild feeling like I'm on ecstasy/MDMA. My body feels light and I have this weird concentration of energy above my neck at the back of my head.

Tired of it all,"I'm tired of faking confidence, because if you're not confident, no one will talk to you. I'm tired of faking happiness. I'm tired of being me. If you look at my post history, its all just complaining because I have no one else to tell, so I come to reddit. Complaining is all I'm good for. I dont have any worth, and my whole life is evidence that proves it. If I had the balls to actually kill myself, I probably would, but I'm afraid of hurting myself and death.

Today has been tough.,"Today has been harder than most. 

Bit backstory: my girlfriend and I recently broke up. It was something out of our control and I don’t blame her or hate her for it, but it meant upending my life and moving 300 miles away and back in with my parents after 7 years of being in my relationship and being independent. I left my life and my cats behind, they were basically holding me together at the time. I lost my job in September and have had a really hard time finding work. So as you can imagine I’m feeling pretty low right now. 

The main issue: my mother and I have never really gotten along. She’s unpleasant to be around for long periods of time. Fine in small doses though. She basically shits on everything I do or try to do. There’s always something negative that she brings to the equation that takes the wind out of my sails. 

I went for a job interview last week, it went okay. Wasn’t great, wasn’t terrible. I was confident that I was on the border of getting it. I got the rejection email this afternoon. It felt like I got kicked in the stomach by a shire horse. It was an awful feeling being knocked back. I applied for 43 jobs and that was my only interview and I didn’t get it. I was feeling pretty bad, then my mum came in to the room. She decided now was a good time to ask “what would you do if you didn’t have me and your dad to feed you and keep you?” A pleasant topic of conversation. I said, “well, I’d be homeless and sleeping rough I’d imagine mum.” She didn’t seem satisfied by this response and decided to go on a tirade about how I should seek unemployment benefits and such. Which I would, but my last ounce of pride won’t let me. I should also mention that I haven’t asked for a penny of charity from her since I got back. Anything she and my dad have paid for is listed on my phone and I fully intend on paying her back when I’m working or have some money coming in. I haven’t loaned money from my mum since I was at uni. Not because I didn’t need the help, I just couldn’t handle the arguing anymore. My sister however, currently owes my mum and dad thousands and they don’t chase her for it. Whenever she needs help they drop what they are doing to help her. I don’t know if I’m just bitter about that because my mum makes the statement “we treat you both the same” all the time, but I know they don’t. 

She continued to twist the knife until I couldn’t take it anymore and just walked out of the room. 

I should say, that she doesn’t seem to mind having me around when a delivery is coming and she wants to go and see a friend, or when I make lunch and dinner, or when I do housework. I feel like a should help out around the house where I can. Most of the time it’s not good enough for her, but at least I tried. 

After all of this I’m just left with this feeling of uselessness and that I’ll never be good enough. Maybe I’m being over sensitive with how much is going on (my ex and I broke up last month, so not that long ago). I don’t know. All I know is I’m not sure how much of this I can take.",ithinkineedhelp188,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe22sx/today_has_been_tough/

No motivation to do anything.,"Very painfully (for me) over the past few months I've lost my best friend. Despite my trying to make things better I couldn't salvage things. We've gone from a really good friendship to barely talking at the end of the day, mostly because of routine. I still care about this person greatly, but its pretty clear thats not the case for this person

Over that time period, my mental state has just gone down the drain. This person was really my only reason to get out of bed in the morning, and be the best version of me that I can be.

I've gone from an A student, to a B student, to a C student, and now im having trouble bringing myself to do any schoolwork at all. I just want to lay down and sleep, even though im getting less than 5 hours a night.

I've been having suicidal thoughts for the past month and I honestly dont know how much longer I can hold out, with the lonliness and the stress given for being an academic student (Canadian system)

I've always been more of a lonely kid, but over this friendship I was shown how much greener the grass is when you have someone to talk to, someone that (seems) to enjoy your company, and can make you smile.",CanadianLanBoy,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe20bu/no_motivation_to_do_anything/
My local hospital doesn’t take my depression and PTSD seriously.,"A bit of background:
I’m 25, F and live in eastern Canada. I live in a small town where more people here fake being ill to get out of work or have other habits.

I’ve been suffering from depression for as long as I can remember being alive. I was first fully aware that I wanted to die since I was 6, I’ve begged for it every day of my life since then and every birthday, that’s what I wished for; even til this very day. 



I’ve been going to a doctor in my town to continue working on my depression, she prescribed me medication which started to make my state worse by an increased amount of suicidal thoughts, more flashbacks, and now irritation as well as mood swings. I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, Dysthymia and Anxiety. I’m constantly trying to make it a point to address to every doctor I’ve been to in the past 8 years that I literally hate being alive and I’ve even been honest as to how many times in a span of a year Ive tried to commit suicide, even up to date. I’ve tried signing myself into our local hospital to try to be admitted to get real help and they’ve only ever kept me for a night each time. Ive begged to stay and I’m still sent home since I seem calm. 

I have always acted like I was fine in front of people since I was raised that it was not okay to be depressed or show negative emotions as I had an abusive mother. Because of that, I can’t express sadness normally, instead I just seem calm and most thing I’m being sarcastic or trying to be funny. I don’t openly cry in front of others since I honestly hate people seeing me cry when I’m a support figure for a lot of people I know. 


I’ve tried making appointments with psychiatrists (we don’t have psychologists at our hospital, they’re hours away and I can’t drive), but they often push Ativan which doesn’t react well with me. I’ve spoken to therapists and they have said I’m getting help in that way but I also need to be medicated if therapy isn’t doing much for me. 

Does anyone know what I should do?
I can’t keep fighting this anymore. I’ve been doing all that I can and I feel like it’ll never get better when all I do is hide in a bathroom and cry each night, wish that I was dead if there’s no fix for what’s going on or just isolate myself from others so I won’t be a burden anymore.",LadyDeathXIII,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fe57lt/my_local_hospital_doesnt_take_my_depression_and/
Worth?,"I hate always being reminded our lives are going to school, getting an education, hopefully get a good paying job and pay taxes. I know there are other stuff, Marriage or whatever. But as another year passes, I feel the years flying. I remember being in elementary telling my self in recess, “wow, I’m never getting to high school.” Here I am, I was a positive child and adults had hope for me. It’s sad to see depression hold me down. If I need to be happy I need to change something. I hate taking meds and being on a schedule. People are gonna treat me different if they find out. My dumb arrogant self also lashed out at my girl best friend. I think she hates me. I said sorry like a million times, I wrote paragraphs to get her to forgive me. She recently came up front and told me she was feeling suicidal recently, and me getting mad at her just made it worst. I’m trying to fix it as best as I can. She said if she can get a hug but she still won’t talk to me in class, hallways, or over text. Her reason is she doesn’t like getting personal. And she’s told me in the past she’s had family problems, so I know she’s stressed. I don’t know if I’m annoying her but I’m keeping positive vibes. Just today one of my “friends” with ADHD said his friend was gonna give him a gun and shoot two teachers. I trust one of my gym teachers the most in the school, more than my family. I mean the guys gone through it. I had him for class a year ago, and in that same year he was divorced. He knows depression and stress. Anyways I told him and he thanked me a bunch. I think he’s speculated I have depression, he’s a health teacher and I always talk to him so I know he knows somethings off. He sent me to the VP and told him the story. They both basically hailed me for keeping the school safe. And I’m grateful. I like being reminded people care for me, I just don’t see it. And neither do you probably. Think of an old teacher or friend you always talked too, I’m betting they’re missing you right now. 


Alright I know I wrote a lot but it just kind of blurted out, I knew I had some stuff going on, but now I’ve wrote it out I see the bigger picture of my self. I’m sorry if I’m not making sense, it doesn’t to me either.

What do you do when no one can help?,"I went to a school counselor to talk about some recent &gt;!sexual!&lt; trauma and general ill feelings and I left there feeling worse about myself.

I haven’t been to therapy since 2014, and it was mostly for dealing with depression symptoms.  Therapy helped me tremendously, and I felt better talking  with complete transparency about my baggage with someone equipped to handle it. I went back recently and the interaction boiled down to them telling me 1) I was medicated at too young of an age (started SSRIs very young) and therefore my parents raised me incorrectly, and 2) Skepticism that the therapy ever helped me. He literally asked me, “did that even help if you stopped going?”

He told me his background was in social service, and he recorded the session for the school’s records. He also told me that after this preliminary session he would refer me to a person with the proper  training, but after our session ultimately decided he would take me on for appointments “I don’t normally do this, but scheduling is too hard right now”

Realizing My Friends Might Not Really Care For Me The Way I Thought They Did,"   Well, I’ve been thinking about posting on here and you know what? Today I’m just going to do it. I’ve been feeling abnormally sad for almost five years now. I’ve never gone to get clinically diagnosed with depression so I won’t say I have it-but after having some dark thoughts these past three years...I won’t deny it if that ends up being the case.
   I have always had a small group of friends, and that circle is down to three. Out of those three friends, I have had one since 1st grade. After a mess up on my part (that happened almost three years ago), we haven’t been as close as we once were. We don’t share emotional things anymore. But we do laugh and joke a lot. That’s mainly what our friendship is now. We only talk when we see one another, and if we contact each other over text-she usually finds a way to cut the conversation short. I know I’m loosing her. It hurts but I know she will find someone better than me to be by her side....
   I have a second friend, she’s been my friend since 6th grade. I don’t feel like I’m loosing her as much as the others-but life issues are getting in the way of me seeing her so we haven’t been able to talk much-if at all...
  And my last-perhaps my closest friend now, just admitted today that he doesn’t believe in the whole ‘friendship’ ordeal. He said that he believes none of his friends actually like him-and he said that right to my face today. He’s detached from people, and when he thinks people don’t care about him...he doesn’t care about them. On top of that he’s been really distant lately, and we don’t have the deep conversations like we did in the past. When we talk it’s about nothing in particular and it hurts the most seeing him go because he’s always been there for me during my super low times. In response to what he said, I promised him that I would never stop trying to show him that I cared for him, but he brushed me off and said have fun trying.
   I feel like I’m loosing my friends slowly. I don’t talk to anyone anymore. I feel alone. I hate going out into public because that reminds me of how people have friends...when mine are slowly fading. I don’t know what to do anymore. They are the reason I’ve been pushing through-and the reason I have pushed through in these past five years. I don’t know what to do.
   I can’t talk to them because they aren’t very emotional, and the one that is (the one that I haven’t been able to see due to life issues) doesn’t deserve this type of weight on her shoulders. I guess this is just more of a vent to get this off my shoulders. I could go on and on about so many different things but...this is the one that has been killing me as of lately.

I'm tired of being alive,"I haven't been sleeping much lately, I wake up with heavy drowsiness, despite not being able to fall asleep. I don't want to continue like this, I don't want to live if this is what life is.

My daily thoughts are riddled with shame, regret, disappointment, anger, and worry. There is so much I wish I had done differently, or not at all. I don't talk to anyone about it because no one would quite understand. It is much easier said than done to not compare oneself to others, forgive, or move on from the past. I haven't lived a day of my life at the age of 25 because of my circumstances and poor decision making.

I feel helpless and powerless. The world is hostile, overly competitive, and parasitic. The deluded turn to their illusions of grandeur via religion, but no loving god would allow this atrocity of a world. I don't feel I have a place that I belong

I wish I had made friends sooner, I don't have anyone now and I feel that I am just a burden. I wish I had gotten a job instead of letting myself be pressured into post secondary education, I have no money or direction now and I feel that I am a failure. I wish I had stood up for myself in bad relationships, I don't have any self respect now and I feel that I am a weak loser. I wish I had matured sooner, I am very far behind in life and I feel that I cannot catch up. I wish I had any confidence in myself, I am convinced that it is too late to make anything worthwhile because the foundations of my life are rotten and building on rotten foundation is recipe for disaster.

I wish I had a better family, a better community, a better world to live in, and I wish I was a better person. No matter what anyone says, I don't believe much can change.

I'm not like others, I wish I was. I can't use social media at all because it floors me to see others doing things I wanted to do, and seeing the results of the better choices they made.

I wish life were easier, people were kinder, mistakes could be undone, and I wish I didn't feel so down all the time.

I belt myself to stop thinking about women and it's breaking me,"I was bullied for most of my school life. It started to get better at around 11th grade. Before that I have never really experianced girls that were nice to me. But for as long as I can think I have been dreaming about the soft touch of a woman. Not sexually but just being hugged. Or snuggling. Now at the end of 10th grade I started self-improving like theres no tomorrow. And it went uphill for me real quick. I started to work out daily, started fighting sports, joined the volunteer firefighters, volunteer wildlandfirefighters and recently sent out my application for the german red cross. It all went well exept one thing. I still wanted a girl to like me. Now more than ever before after I finished firefighting training and had my first ""psychologically demanding"" firecalls. Sometimes I just come home and wish that a girl would just come out of nowhere and hug me. I am still a kissless virgin even though from the outside I may even be desireable. At least thats what some people tell me. But because most of my life there weren't really any girls that were nice to me, I interpret every single nice thing from a girl as some kind of flirt. Then I get feelings for almost every single girl there was. They could be as bitchy as anything but as long as they're a woman, I would develop feelings for her and make advances. Openly flirting with almost every girl I knew. I was sort of known as the needy guy. Some people told me and I slowly realised that I had no chance with girls if I act like this. Then one of my ""favorite crushes"" (there are a lot of them) had a long talk to me. I told her how I felt about my needyness and my past. She told me I dont have any chance with her (she told me before) but that if I stopped thinking about girls all the time then maybe someone would actually turn up. That was the first time I really talked to someone about my problem and it was devastating. I couldn't stop thinking about women. For years when I'm home alone I'd pretend that there was a girl in my bed. Asking how ""her"" day was, making out with the pillow and everything. Sometimes at dinner I would put two plates on the table and just talk with ""her"" about ""her"" day. I didn't know how to help myself and because of all my volunteering work and sports I don't have time for a therapist. So then I had the idea of punishing myself if I'd think about women. And with no other ideas I started doing that. Every day I'd take my leather belt, take off my top and start belting away at my back. I'd take my phone and turn on porn and start belting myself so I would stop getting an erection when something sexual happens. At school and volunteering work I'd pinch my trizeps real hard whenever I'd think about women or would look at a girls butt or breasts. Now everytime I see a girl I'd just catch a glimpse of her and quickly look away. In the beginning it helped. I stopped thinking about girls. But after some time I was on edge all the time. Hurting myself at the slightest thought of someone. I'd look at women at firecalls or when I otherwise needed to. But otherwise I'd look away. And now it just hurts. My confidence has plumeted. I'm looking at the ground the whole time. I have spots on my back and arms. I am feeling like shit all day. Tired and with no motivation for anything anymore. I just dont know what to do anymore.",DerGuteAlteBen,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdvb4i/i_belt_myself_to_stop_thinking_about_women_and/
First post here many years of depression,"Hi, depression is something I’ve been dealing with off and on for at least 15 years. I’m 33 married with two young kids, I come from a family with parents who want to be supportive but do not really understand depression and mental health problems. It’s made worse by the fact my two younger siblings are already more accomplished than I am. Anyways I’ve been in therapy 3 times over the last 15 years and quite honestly it’s been a disaster each time, I’m to the point where I no longer believe in psychotherapy as a legitimate means to help myself.

This recent bout has started late October and has been moving into the severe, life affecting depression the last two months. It’s made much worse by having to look my wife and precious children in the eyes everyday knowing I’m failing them. My wonderful children 2.5 and 1 year old bring me so much joy but then so much anxiety that I am failing them, wasting my life in a malaise with no real impending problems. 

Probably the worst part is people who know me but don’t live with me would never know this, even when depressed I can fake it in social situations and I would say people think I’m funny, personable and when I’m not depressed I have a keen mind and have had some mild success in business or other endeavors. So people would be shocked to read or hear how tortured I feel mentally. 

Like an idiot I fell into old traps, trying to just “take the edge off” with a couple drinks in the morning just to get through the tough times, Which the veteran depressed reading this will be shaking their heads knowing how much worse that makes it. Luckily I recognized it early enough and cut it out cold turkey and haven’t had a sip in 10 days or so. Right now I just need some inertia to get out the door, run my small business and provide for them. Today is the worst I’ve felt in years, paralyzed by my demons, it’s absolute agony. 

Becoming a father has been the best thing that’s ever happened to me, but if I fail my children and wife I’ll never ever forgive myself. I need to face things head on but it’s that fear of what damage I’ve done the last few months being negligent and having to once again dig myself out of this hole. You see I know more major bouts of depression are in my future but I worry how many more recoveries I have in me, I make life so hard on myself with the inconsistencies, it’s such torture. 

Thanks for giving me a forum to say this.",Lionsjunkie,9,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fduput/first_post_here_many_years_of_depression/

"Nothing matters anymore, getting worse"," Hi..I don't know where else to go. I am devastated right now, feeling like I'm spiraling out of control, I feel so fucking numb from crying my lungs out. Even my best friend is no longer supportive, my family, parents at home are shit. I have no real friends who care, and I can't be bothered to do anything right now, I just want to sleep without waking up to see another morning. I feel so fucking pathetic and shit, I cut myself regularly now and I'm having so much fucking self pity, I'm pretending to be normal because I don't want to lose my best friend, the only person who has helped me come this far from previous suicidal attempts. But suppressing it makes it so much fucking worse I feel like nobody fucking cares, no matter how many times I shout for help. No one close to me cares. I don't know what to do. I'm leaning towards paracetamol poisoning all over again, if I die I die, If I don't I try a different method. I just feel like absolute shit, jobless. I regret everything in my life, every fucking thing, I don't know who to trust anymore, I don't even have a fucking shoulder to lean on while crying my lungs out. Im in a LDR, from past 6 months, (not prior to that) as she's studying overseas, I can't even fucking have her hold me in her arms when I'm feeling like shit. She is the best and supportive, and my best friend but I can't hurt her by harming myself so It's a fucking struggle. I just feel so enraged and angry at everything..I can't fucking find a job due to covid-19. Sometimes it feels like If I had some money to get myself kicked off I can go near her and find a job and at least stay sane. But right now it all seems so fucking impossible I feel like I'm such a fucking mess and I just wish to fucking die right now, I feel so much burden when I inhale, I just want to die.

I need help I am sad,"Hi so I would like to know what's your opinion on this.

So there was an activity at my college, in which students from different schools were coming the univ to see it and explore it. When they came, the college gave them a ticket to get a free meal. We, students of the college itself, are really unhappy with the university because they always have money for anything but the university itself, charging us a lot of money for things that are not there. So we, unleashed, decided to take back what's ours. One guy printed out a lot (maybe like 15-20) tickets of the food and we went there to get the food by ourselves. So at the end of the day, the food was done earlier than usual. We did it only for 2 days out of the 3 days the whole college stuff was happening.  We didnt do it the last day cause they realized something was wrong and printed out a different ticket. So we didnt go, also because they were being suspicious and asking questions. 

Do you think we are getting punished?it was only like 25 juice boxes and sandwiches, that's it, out of the probably 200 or 300 there were there.

Getting work done when Depression is telling you that you can’t do anything and you’re worth nothing kills me. (Unfortunately not literally),"Hey. 16M here. I’m just a wee little high schooler but I feel like I’ve been through a whole ass war with my own fucking brain. For context, my depression got intense at around 7th-9th grade. Finally it’s started to slow down and I don’t want to kill myself as much as I did in middle school. But not everything’s is so hunky dory. I don’t know if I’m alone on this and I doubt I am, but it’s so hard to get motivated to do anything but play video games and smoke weed. Now I know I’ll probably be told that the weed isn’t helping with my motivation, which it isn’t, but that isn’t the issue. My issue is that I don’t have any drive to want to better myself or to do anything other than what is fun to me. Am I alone here? Is this because of something other than my depression? 

I never do homework, I never study, and these days it’s actually affecting all of my grades and that kills me because I could get away with doing *some* of my homework and get amazing grades on tests and 9 times out of 10 I’d pass with a C or above. But now I’m getting Fs in my classes and I just want to quit. I can’t find a reason to continue being in this useless place we call school for my “education”.

"Looked In the mirror, and fuck man.","

I have run into 2 major problems in my life atm, it has been eating away at me for the better part of a month. I’ll give you some backstory:

I have people pleaser all my life. I feel like I have always gone with the flow, with people’s expectations of me rather than have my own. I have done that since I was a kid and I’m now turning 20 this year, And with that being said the first problem I have run into is, I don’t know what I want and like partly due to the depression. But mostly due to the fact that I’ve never really done or said what I wanted to to outside forces shutting me down at every turn (school, parents etc.). Idk and it’s driving me up a wall.


2: I thought hard about the people pleaser trait in my being a lot and I have come to this conclusion, I hate who I am. I believe that I am selfish and feel because I haven’t done what I have wanted in my life I am inauthentic. So I go and look for outside validation and love because I feel like I am incapable of it. But when I receive it, and it doesn’t hit the way I wanted it to or things are too fast or far. Like a addict I dump them and look for a new person to give me that feeling I long for. It’s fucked up, because the other people care about me and I do to to an extent, but I prioritize my own feelings and shit first. And that realization fucked me up so bad. Real bad.

I have nowhere and no one else to say this,"This is going to be a long post because i have a lot to say, sorry in advance.

 I dont see any way my life can get on track, I'm 23 years old, i have achieved nothing noteworthy in life and i've generally lived a life of isolation, this stems all the way back from secondary school where i was relentlessly bullied for being black and overweight, i was only 11 years old when i first got diagnosed with depression because of the sheltered life i had lived before then meant i had no idea what people would be like once i got to high school, no one told me that being black was something that people may not like, no one told me that being overweight would be something kids would make fun of, but it happened, for 4 years straight, throughout high school i ran into various obstacles i'd never want a kid to go through, almost weekly fights, bad report cards and parents evenings lead to detentions and 3 day exclusions which lead to me starting to simply skip school and not go, i tried so hard to get myself kicked out of that school because my mother would not take me out of the school, i didnt understand why then and i still dont understand now and i think part of me resents her for that to this day, i truly believe my life could have been so different if i didnt get forced to stay at the school that almost killed me multiple times. 

The bullying definitely subsided a touch in the last year, with kids wanting to get into good 6th forms they started looking to just finishing their exams i guess? But the damage was already done, i started school a pretty normal happy kid with a fair few friends who didnt think about much besides what pokemon i needed to catch to fill my national dex or if i the cartoon i wanted to watch was recorded but by my last year i was could barely be bothered to do anything, i didnt talk to anyone i simply went to school and got the bus home and avoided people at all costs, i had skipped way too much school to get good grades and i could motivate myself to want to study, i was getting the bare minimum to get into 6th form and hopefully that was enough to scrape by. But as if things wern't bad enough i went on a residential school trip with one of my classes that was cut short because I ended up having a severe athsma attack when we got the the accommodation camp, this was my first time having an athsma attack and my first time i'd have ever been to hospital and i was only 15 so my first feelings were obviously of extreme panic, a small part of me i'd say was honestly relieved, maybe this was the end and i wouldnt have to go on, the ambulance got there and i must have asked the responded a hundred times if i was going to die, obviously she cant tell a child 'probably' so she said no and was comforting me, the ride to the hospital felt like an eternity. To wrap this part up obviously i didnt die but i had woken up a week later in the icu surrounded by my family, it was weird seeing my dad and mum together as well as their partners because they had been split up for a long time but i was just happy i woke up i guess. I had to stay in hospital for a few days more after i woke up for tests and rehab, getting used to walking again after being in bed for a week was interesting and a lot harder than i ever thought it would be, i was told that people who suffer acute asthma attacks generally have a low survival rate, i cant remember the exact number but it was low enough to cause a reaction from everyone. We left the hospital and i was told i wouldnt be able to go back to school for at least a month, obviously any kid would be thrilled to hear that but i was super happy because it meant time away from hell on earth. 

However the recovery process during that month kind of set the precedent for a hole i got trapped in and am still trapped in, doing nothing for a month meant i got into some pretty lazy habits but also i got used to being on my own world just playing xbox and watching tv during the day. Transitioning back into school life was harder than anticipated because it was half days to start off with and that was for about 2 weeks. Fast forward a bit and the bullying starts again because fuck it why not bully the kid fresh out of hospital right? it gets to exam period and i have full on sacked off school, i skip most days and get put into the assisted education program where you take exams in a different room and have a personal TA and some counselling sessions, of course none of this really helped me because i just didnt have any care for my education i just wanted away from school asap. I by some miracle without studying at all managed to scrape by with enough GCSE qualifications to go to 6th form on the condition that i would have to take english and maths alongside a foundation year. This leads onto my next problem:

For more reasons unknown to me which i can only chalk up to she cant be bothered, my mum decided for me that i wasnt going to go to a college in my hometown, i would have to instead go to live with my dad and do my 3 years of college there. Now i should probably explain why this is a problem, my dad and I dont get on well, we havent for as long as i stopped being a child and we still have barely any real relationship, i just talk to him like once a month to talk to my little brother and sister who obviously i have no reason to not have a relationship with. I wont go into as much detail here because this post is already feeling too long but theres so much more to get through. Long story short my dad was extremely emotionally abusive, anything that he didnt like would be met with screaming banging on things and threats of physical violence, this would be for anything from not doing the dishes to not studying earlier than what was on my plan. This again warped my view of education because i wasnt really doing courses i enjoyed but rather what was available to me and i didnt feel inspired to commit to it by studying, most of my study time was just sneaking my phone on silent. This went on for 3 years straight, i was isolated, the only person i really interacted with was my abusive dad and my teachers and classmates when i had to. When i tried to confide in my mother she simply told me other people including herself had it worse and hes just strict and does it because he cares about me and wants whats best. So i gave up on that as well. Throughout my life one of the few things i really enjoyed was playing video games and I used it as an escape to just ignore my real life situation and responsibilities, how healthy that is is up for debate but if i didnt have that escape who knows if i'd even be typing this here now. He didn't like that i played video games because he said that it was pointless and took away time i could be studying or looking for work, so he took it away and never let me have it back on any occasion after half of the first year. 

Thats when things got really bad for me, without something to pass the time and take my mind off of things my depression and suicidal tendencies came flooding back, i started self harming and i still look at the scars along my arms sometimes and get reminded of how bad things were back then, i never thought that they would still be there 6 years later, i wish i had thought about that. Somehow 3 years later again without really putting in any effort i managed to complete my A levels and get enough points to get into University. on a foundation entry degree, I guess this was when i was happiest because i was finally free from my parents and maybe i could be someone new and different, I never would have imagined myself where I am now 4 years ago.

Uni life started off fine, i was still avoiding people and keeping to myself but a couple of people on my course would always sit next to me and try to talk to me, I guess because seeing someone sitting on their own in their first year of Uni made them want to include me so i even managed to have friends, the first year had some hardships because i was never taught how to budget or be independent so of course money got tight towards the end but aside from that i don't think my first year had any issues, i passed without any issues and found myself advancing to the first year of the actual degree. I wont go into detail for every year but i'll just say that apart from the odd times we'd go out together I still mostly stayed in my flat playing games or watching stuff online, I didnt party and I didnt study, I just kind of drifted, then for whatever reason i cannot remember i got into an argument with my mum, i cant remember what about but she sent me a message saying that she was done with me and i didnt really know what to feel, I just kind of stopped, I stopped going to uni, i stopped going out i stopped everything, i just started spending every day waking up, playing games and eating junk food, sleep, repeat. As you can imagine having a lifestyle like this really did a number on my mental and physical health. I would go an entire week without showering sometimes more, my only human contact was taking my food from downstairs, this was my lowest point. 

Obviously i failed the year because i didnt attend or do all the work. The next year i was allowed to stay at the Uni and take up a different course, thinking that i could just power through it, but apparently during all of this student finance (the company that pays your tuition fees) turned around and said they wouldn't fund this year of learning for me, which obviously kind of fucked me over completely. Because they told me I wouldn't be funded i decided that there was no point in going, because i certainly don't have 9k just laying around to pay the fees myself, I didn't attend a single lecture all year and lived the same unhealthy life i had lived towards the end of the previous year for the entire year, it was horrible. The one beacon of hope that i could find was that eventually i had to start benefits as i didnt get money to pay the rent or anything so that covered that, meanwhile there was a local game store that ran a tournament for the game a play and i really enjoyed going to that once a week and made friends with the team i was assigned to, my life finally felt like it had some form of normality, i had a decent friend group, i was finally going out and i had something to look forward to whilst i tried to find proper work to fill my time and move into my own place, but unfortunately i couldnt find work and it came time to decide what i was going to do next in the summer, at this time i had another argument with my mum because she began to catch on that clearly something was wrong and i didnt want to go to university and do a degree i had no interest in.

We hadn't spoken in almost a month and i was sure we had cut ties but then she messaged me pleading me to come to an open day for a course that did in all honestly sound extremely appealing to me so i went and the place seemed nice and this where I am now, i got onto the course and i'm currently here now in the same situation but worse that i was in for the 3rd year at the previous uni, i havent attended almost any of the classes i'm almost certainly going to be kicked out or have to retake the year, but thats not even the worst part, the worst part is that i'm still being asked to pay for other years that i was told would be funded including this year, meaning i'm in an insane amount of debt with no way to pay it off, this year also isn't being funded despite being told it would be and i'm currently in negative balance in my bank account with the next payment of my underfunded maintenance loan coming in on the 20th of next month, i havent eaten in 3 days already and i dont feel all that good, my parents aren't an option and i have tried to ask for help in the loans/assistance reddits but i got marked as a scammer because i wasn't getting any replies but kept trying, I don't know what to do, I think I am well and truly ready for the end, I don't see how I can recover from this hole i put myself into, I'm 23 years old, with no degree, debt, no work experience meaning i cant get any jobs despite the 100's of applications i've probably sent off by now, i've never had a romantic partner, hell i've never even had a real best friend, i'm completely alone and I don't think anyone will miss me when i'm gone.

I'm sorry this was such a long read, but I don't have anyone else to talk to and really explain things to, so this is my last resort, I dont think i want to die, but i really don't see how I can live on.",alttaalt,7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdufdz/i_have_nowhere_and_no_one_else_to_say_this/

I have a question.,I’ve been told it’s normal with depression to be confused with your feelings but I don’t know what my emotion is I can’t pin point it unless I’m super depressed because then I know I’m super depressed but while I’m not I don’t know what I am or who or what I’m feeling I feel like a liar and that I’m faking everything but I know I’m not.,DepressJoker,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdy9kd/i_have_a_question/
I hate my best friend,"let me start off by saying that I hate my best friend sometimes not all the time. The basic reason is because she's so perfect and I feel like such a waste and piece of shit when I see her. I'm 16 and a sophomore in high school. We met last year as freshmen and I had never had any friends before so I immediately just accepted her. She was 13 when we met so she started kindergarten early and skipped a grade. then there's me who's two years older but nothing compared to her. She gets straight A's, takes all AP and honors classes, made VARSITY softball as a freshman (age of a 7th grader), got the lead roles in all the theatre shows, and just has a perfect life. 

Then there's me who doesn't have the best home life. I've tried telling her I can't sleep over because I need my meds and for other reasons. But then she just tells me ""oh everyone feels sad sometimes. You don't need those stupid pills."" Or if I tell her that it's my anxiety and ADHD pills she is like ""everyone has some form of ADHD. Have you seen everyone who can't pay attention? Those pills don't do anything""

I'm very reluctant to end our friendship because I don't have any other friends. Also my Mom has gotten really close with their family and I can't end the friendship beacuse that would be awkward. I feel like this is toxic though. Idk maybe it's just cause I'm not good enough I feel like shit.",joho3883,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdu7fp/i_hate_my_best_friend/

I'm having a hard time.,"What do u do when you're in a dark place?
I'm married, I have one kid, dog, cat, house to clean.
I'm sick rn (just cold, but I have UC, so it's worse for us). Last yeah I was in hospital 5 times. This year one. All. Because of stupid UC. I hate myself, I hate how I look. I don't feel any support or love from anyone in my life except my little daughter. She's the only reason I don't commit suicide. I don't have strength anymore. There are plans to have 3 surgeries in near future. One of them is gastric sleeve - because I can't get rid of the weight because if the medicine I use, I feel ugly and fat. I miss the lovely feeling u get from first kisses, from love, excitement, happiness. It's just... My life is dark rn. I think about suicide alot, I've told my husband, mom (who doesn't belive clinical depression is a real thing), my therapist (who has a hard time with me, because I'm a stubborn little Satan). I don't know what to do... I know where I can get sleeping pills, so I'm just afraid my daughter will loose her mother soon.
And I'm in Norway, I'm afraid of telling doctors about my suicide thoughts because here they are really happy to take away child from your family for every little shit. I don't know what to do. I'm done with this whole life and shit. I have pain in my whole body and I don't have any pain relief meds (because Norway only gives you paracetamol fuckery).",DepressedPandaLola,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdw7fv/im_having_a_hard_time/

Suicide Attempt?,"A couple weeks ago, I overdosed on some Xanax I had lying around and chased it down with some vodka. It put me into a deep sleep and that took me around 36 hours to completely recover from. A friend found me at some point during this since I wasn't returning any of their calls and they know what I struggle with. Anyway, for some reason, I haven't really thought about what happened at all since then and I guess I kind of just shook it off (or tried to). But now that I'm thinking about it, I'm questioning what my intent was behind doing what I did. I didn't ""plan"" to kill myself but I remember thinking to myself ""if this kills me, that's okay."" Should I consider this a suicide attempt or just an odd lapse of judgement? I should mention that I have attempted suicide before and the thought process was much different than what happened this time which is part of the reason I'm so confused.",mthammer1,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdsdvo/suicide_attempt/
Advice on getting out of the mentality of not wanting to live.,"I know it’s better to see an expert rather than stranger on the internet but I’ve been to 2 therapist and they haven’t helped. 
I’m 23, male, fit and healthy, come from a good upper middle class family who support me well and I really have no hard struggles to deal with. Despite all this since about the age of 10 I’ve wished I was never born and would rather be dead. Really the only thing keeping me from suicide is that I don’t want to put my family/ loved ones through that pain. This may be decent enough to keep me alive but still isn’t much of a viewpoint to live from, there are times I resent my family because I have to endure the pain and stress of life just because of them. 

I would just much rather be dead than go through the stress of living and working for the rest of my life, call it depression or laziness or whatever but it’s just my viewpoint in life and I can’t shake it. 
Does anyone out there have a similar mentality and have ever thought or been told anything to truly shift them out of that mindset? Therapy has never done anything to help me shift out of this and I almost feel like it’s too much of a therapist to be able to do so.",Imagine17,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdw24a/advice_on_getting_out_of_the_mentality_of_not/
Hugs,"Sometimes I dream about being hugged by my friends,when I am with them I just keep looking at them hugging other people and thinking ""I want a hug too"" but in the end I just try to forget about it,I don't expect to get a hug,so why should I ask for one?",gafsr,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fduuvo/hugs/
I'm tired,"How do I say that I want to lay in bed all day and do nothing? How could I convey to my parents that not wanting to exist is one of few thoughts that I have? I don't want to work, but still my parents force me to, I know this might sound as if I'm lazy. And I am, no doubt in that. 

Tbh I didn't ask to be born, let alone grow up to do stuff that I'm not interested in. If I were to have my dream job, I'd work on it in my pace, but obviously that isn't how it works.

I always come to work, most of the time I'm late, 10-20 mins but I still arrive and work. 

Now I want to run away, cuz I'm tired of them complaining about how I always sleep or that I'm lazy and do nothing all day, that I'm always in my room and not check in on them. That I can't smoke weed to cope with my thoughts.

We only get one life. One. I don't want to spend that time thinking about suicide, and then complain in my head about the options and how painful or too fast it's going to be. 

I don't want to run away, but most of our time we've been together all I hear is an in depth negative comment of how my life is, and contrast to a simple ""I love you."" I do get ""how are you feeling today?"" Or ""what are you up to today?"" But I can't say anything with honesty cuz then they'll start to ask questions that I can't answer without breaking down and shit. 

I almost don't care about family and friends. But I think one fateful day, I'll make that irrational decision and run away. I really am tired of listening to the implications of how bad my life is, and I don't want to hear it anymore. I just need a little push that goes a little too far, then I'll probs snap and head the fuck out. Who knows.

I'm angry at myself and them, and honestly I want to hit stuff and scream at the top of my lungs. But I gotta keep it together, right?

Took a creative writing class because it's the only thing I'm good at. Now I feel like sh*t.,"Writing is basically my only talent. It's the one thing I can do with consistency. I'm not athletic. My art is passable but nowhere near good. I can't do stuff with computers. I can't make music. Don't do anything with friends because I don't really have any. So I write. 

Didn't mesh with one of my classes for this semester. Subbed it with a CW class because why not? We had to do a setting/dialogue assignment a while ago and just got them back. 

In short, I did sh*t, apparently. 

Basically, it wasn't really what we were supposed to do for the assignment. That's fine; I misunderstood the instructions and will do better next time. The problem is, he didn't say he liked anything I did. I did a little piece based on a project I've been kicking around that I really liked. I thought it was good. I wanted it to be good. I wanted someone who does this stuff professionally for a living to think it was good. But the note he left read to me like he didn't really care about it or didn't like it. 

And that hurts. Really really hurts. Writing is basically my only talent. I want to publish something someday. I want to be able to hold a book I wrote in my hands and feel like all those sh*tty experiences I had in high school and so far in college could be balanced out by something good I did under my own power without anyone else. Something that could only be chalked up to me. Something that could get me some modicum of respect. Something that could prove I'm not just some boring person with nothing interesting about them who's completely, utterly average.

I feel as if nobody cares about me, and that life will never get better at all. I've never had anybody i'd consider a true friend really my entire life and now i'm 20, it's starting to really hurt. My social circle consists of two people, to which i'm sure they can't stand me. They're always making stupid jokes and putting me down, but - shit, they're the closest people I have to real friends, and the only people I talk to on a daily basis. I'm at rock bottom right now. Every single friendship I've ever tried to make has just turned people away from me, like i'm some monster. I don't even feel human anymore. I don't feel like I fit in anywhere. I need help.

"How I feel at the moment. If anyone needs any motivation to seek help, this is it. Years of avoiding signals to get help can lead to a breaking point if the person isn't strong mentally, like me.","The last couple of months    ,             I've been tired . 

 I wanna die. Really badly. I don't wan't to cause the people that somehow still love me this pain, they need me here. But I am just so tired, so fucking tired.  I'm tired of this sad, mean, world. I feel like I can succeed, but I don't see the point if I still will not be happy. On the other hand I get the point, try to make family happy, and spend the little time we have with the ones we love. Someone of you may say, ""at least you are lucky you have people that love you this much"", and that is true. If it wasn't for them, I would not be here a long time ago. However, perhaps the feeling that brings within me the most pain and sorrow is: what if that love is not reciprocated? Don't get me wrong, I love these people. But I don't love spending time with anyone. I don't even love spending time by myself. I don't know what I want or what will make my day better. The thought of going through the same cycles of just trying to find some little piece of happy in the day for me and my loved ones for the rest of my life makes me not want to live through it. I find the bad in every activity, see the negative flaw of every person, while at the same time try to keep 'face' as much as possible. I think I can summarize this feeling into: I feel guilty for the pain that I cause my loved ones, but at the same time I am so fucking selfish. I just can't take it anymore. I feel like I am loosing my shit, I don't even know if I am depressed, crazy, bipolar, i don;t know. It just hurts. I want it to stop. \*I wanted better for myself

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I don't know why I am writing this. 

I don't even want any help or input{

I just want this sadness to go way, I can't go around another day with my head down and my eyes filled with tears. I just feel like I wasn't born to act like this, I wanted to be strong physically and mentally in order to provide for my loved ones, not tear them down with my negativity. 

everyone problem is bigger than mine. I am just a selfish bitch who is too much of a pussy to deal with his own fucking emotions. There are people in this world who have gotten a much shittier hand. yet here i am fucking wanting to die. how does this make any sense?

It's also really hard to hide being so fucking sad; I am 6'6, live with my loving girlfriend, and trying to be social in years when I still had hope means there are still people who think I want friends in my life that try to reach out once in a while. Only to receive an excuse/ insult/ rambling when I try to avoid them. 

&amp;#x200B;

No matter how much effort I put into happiness, I can't seem to get close without cheating. Sure, some things make me happy, but as soon as they do, my mind almost tries to find the negative in the situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

To end this shit, I wanna make a wish.   
I wish for the kids who have to be strong, to have bull sized balls, and help every person in need. 

Because the false sense of protection is the last thing that they need. 

If you can't do it, don't say you can. Because when you don't, or aren't here, they will stay behind wondering why you every left.

I seem to have created this character, or other personality i suppose? Where i just want to fight everyone, and I won’t back down, i’m not normally a fighter and every single time i hate myself for my behaviour the day after. I guess my thinking is that if i get myself into fights, i’m going to get hurt and a part of me is hoping to be seriously injured so i can just have a break from life 🙄

Should I throw the ring out that he gave to me?,This guy and I that I have known for two years have spent time together every day this week and last week.

Rediscovering Meaning in the midth of it,"To everyone out there, the people who have suffered from depression, perhaps for many years. This is my first post, I am, like so many of you lying in bed, have been for many months, known this state for decades.

You are not alone. And whoever you believe yourself to be right now that is not true. remember the person you were when you were fine, happy, in a better place. Feel it, embody that. I know that I am holding on to it. And if life has been mostly dark it helps to believe that experiences of happiness and joy exist somewhere outside of this state...just like Martin Luther king believed in his dreams even at that particular time it seemed impossible.

I do not know what caused you to land hard in this state, for me it was relationship loss, failure, deep loneliness and isolation-I have no family and lost my relationship/friendships to depression- people left-, though life circumstances (financial issues/living environment and of course the abusive childhood) AND my reactions to them e.g. blaming myself, self-sabotage, feeling futile, discouraged, bad habits, unhelpful implicit relational and emotional patterns that keep repeating. Whatever it is that led into this black hole. I guess the situation gets more frustrating with every attempt to heal that did not work. I tried many medications (almost all of them), several psychiatric stays, several years of therapy (CBT, depth psychology), the Hoffmann process, all kinds of meditations, body work, “giving up and surrender”, Eckhart tolle etc you name it.. they all helped a little but nothing really worked in the long term.

And it sucks that nothing seem to work permanently. 

However, I deeply believe that there is meaning imprinted in everyone’s heart. What is your life worth living? What would you like to experience?  If you we’re dying what really matters to you?Lying in bed, can you imagine and feel experiencing it? The happiness, the joy, whatever it is you wish for? In every ayahuasca experience and every other methods that helped me temporary what really helped was seeing clearly this pattern of depression replaying (the thoughts, the emotional pain, the energetic pattern) and then break free of it for a while until familiar patterns re-emerge. It is like getting on a diet and putting on weight again... rebuilding relationships is a huge part of my recovery. So I guess I wanted to reach out to you and ask the question what dreams do you have today? How can you believe in them in your head first and in your body? Often the despair is exactly next to this dream. But keep building that belief. You are not alone, please do not give up. I will not either.",snowinginmay,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdzxh2/rediscovering_meaning_in_the_midth_of_it/

i think it’s time.,"i’m 17, im a senior in high school. i wake up, i go to school, i come home, i do my homework, i do chores around the house, i take care of the pets, i take care of myself, i eat when i should and i shower and i keep my room clean. i go to the gym and i actively produce art. i listen to music, i play guitar, i spend time with my mom and friends. im not unhappy, my life just feels so dull and gray. i’m not sad or angry, i’m not upset about anything. 

there have been previous years of my life that were overcome by anxiety and major depression and self harm and even a suicide attempt. but then i was sad, i was angry and confused and disgusted. i’ve suffered ptsd since age 12, and that affected me a lot. it still affects me, especially now that i have a form a physical ptsd (that’s how my doctor described it, i don’t know what else to call it) from overdosing 2 years when i tried to kill myself. 

but trauma aside, i don’t feel anything negative. of course i have my bad moods like anyone else, but really i’d say i have more good moods than bad moods. i laugh, i smile, i joke (a lot, i’m the comedian of my circle). 

i tell you all of this because it’s so odd that i live my life on autopilot, doing everything i should and being more positive than i used to be. but almost every hour of my day is filled with thoughts of suicide. i fantasize of slicing my wrists open to watch the blood pool in the tub beneath me. i imagine driving to the old hanging tree on the other side of town in the middle of the night and leaving my body dangling for someone to find in the morning. walking on the sidewalk i laugh to myself as i think about jumping in front of the cars rolling by.

SSRIs and NDRIs and not killing libido,"I'm a mid-20s woman with rapid-cycling bipolar II but I'm posting here because I'm asking about antidepressants and how to control my depressive episodes.

My moods were under control when I was on lithium and zoloft, but the zoloft (50 mg, so not much) absolutely ZAPPED my sex drive. I would force myself to do it to please my partner (no, he did not coerce me). Aside from that, I felt the best I'd ever felt. No complaints otherwise.

Last June, I went off the zoloft and stuck with the lithium and felt fine, but I felt some depression symptoms coming back after a couple months. My anxiety and reactivity increased, but I was still WAY better off than with no meds whatsoever.

In December, my psychiatrist recommended an NDRI to help prevent a change in libido. I started wellbutrin (100 mg so again, not much) and it was definitely helping, but now I'm feeling some depression symptoms coming back again. I have spent the last week thinking I'm stupid and pathetic and useless for no apparent reason. My psychiatrist thinks I did better on an SSRI, but the lack of libido was awful and not something I ever want to experience again.

Advice for a significant other of someone with depression,"I have been dating my bf for about 4 months so the relationship is fairly new. Yesterday we were supposed to hangout but he stood me up and texted at 11pm saying he overslept. He told me that we needed to talk about something tomorrow and when I asked if he could give me a topic just so I am not so worried he said it was about his depression. 

We have never discussed depression before however my ex also struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts throughout our 3yr relationship. I always did my best to be loving and supportive to my ex but I also felt like I didn’t know the best things to say. I have also gone through my own low points but always when I was single and extremely alone without friends or supportive family.

And I'm right back where I started...,"I had been doing so well for months and everything has come back full circle, if not worse. This move was supposed to be great for the both of us. More money and better opportunity for him. Getting away from all the bad stuff in our old town and new opportunities for me. But, everything is not how we would hoped it would be. Money is even tighter than before. I don't know how he's going to make his car payment, or pay for internet, or rent. Even make the trip back to see his parents this weekend. Nothing we do seems to be enough or even matter.

I am beyond stressed. I'm barely sleeping anymore, I just can't shut off my mind. All the thoughts racing back and forth in my mind of the things that I should be doing instead of sleeping. Like cleaning, finding a better job or a second job. I lay awake stressing about how to help more when I feel like everything I do now isn't enough, and I'm just waiting for everything to come crashing down. 

Yet, on the other hand, I am ANGRY. I'm angry that I'm getting no help from him. I do all the household chores amidst his claims every day of ""after work I'll come home and clean"". It's my paycheck and any extra cash I get a hold of that is immediately spent on bills because his check wasn't enough because sales were down the last month, or was spent on game passes and subscriptions for games. I was the one who drove there and back to go do his errands while he was sitting on the beach in Mexico with his friends. 

And I. Feel. Terrible. 

I'm right back to being sucked into this numbness, this darkness. All I want again is to just not wake up in the morning. To have everything just be over. The thoughts of suicide and self harm are back in full force and the only reason I haven't harmed, is because I simply don't have a razor blade in the house...

I don't know what to do,"Hi guys,

it is the first time that I write on this sub and it is also one of my first posts but honestly I feel myself sinking and maybe writing about it will help me. By the way I'm Italian so forgive me in advance for my English.

I'm a 20M and I've been suffering depression for 5 years now, before I thought it was adolescent sadness and I have never given it too much weight. But after two path of psychoanalysis with two different psychotherapists I was diagnosed the ""thing"".

I'm struggling every day with suicidal thoughts and the situation is going worst cause the situation in my home is terrible, I live with my grandma (who also suffers of depression and take Xanax and prozac every day) my mother who is a strong career woman but she uses me as her personal therapist since I remember and my little brother who is my only light in this house. My father works in another city and I don't see him that much. In the last six month my father said to my mother he don't love anymore her and there is another woman. I don't judge him, who am I to do it? But now I've always my mum emotionally destroyed that reach for my help, but I don't know how to help her and more the time goes on more I can't talk with my dad normally.

I tried to escape from this situation in October moving away in another city, I thought I need to live alone and away from that house, but the depression strikes hard on me and I had to return in my original home to afford to return in therapy.

Currently the situation is becoming uncontrollable, even my friends have noticed it, I've always been very good at hiding my problems, and one of the last evenings they have made me a sort of intervention for my drinking problem. I honestly reveal them that I don't have suicidal thoughts only when I drink.

I hate my self so much, I'm known in my city for my drunken adventures and I don't like it but the thought of stop drinking kills me.

Overreacting VS social isolation,"I really do not understand why I am isolated for ""coming across"" a certain way. People will judge you based off your innate defense mechanisms, but then the next day, it's like when I hit reset and try again to get to know someone, I can't. I'm a permanent smear of my mistakes. (I'm human, others aren't I guess?) I guess depression has made me ""unapproachable"". Which I don't grasp, because I am constantly in the presence of people who treat me like dirt (which obviously puts me in the offensive).

A lot of people around me also get defended by their friends when they face trials, I.E. ""they're having a hard time, just try to understand them"".  But I get told to change. As if I don't deal with my own? It makes no sense.

Does anyone else do this? Face isolation because people misunderstand their emotional turmoil? This has caused me great hardship, stress, and mental breakdown. It'd be nice to feel normal.

"If you never had a crush, be grateful","It's the worst catalyst to depression. Period. Remember all your problems? Now they are amplified. They feel worse because you feel like you have an escape in love but you don't and you never will. You start fantasizing over and over about the ""salvation"" of your life, the only source of possible happiness that you can imagine, and the more time passes the worse it gets. It hurts and it ruins your head it's either suicide or find salvation in that person. I've never hurt this much over fucking fiction. This person as I know it is in my head. I am in love with a person I created, I don't even know this person, just her exterior, yet I feel like I'm close to this person and it hurts not imagining a fake relationship. It hurts so fucking bad it feels good to think abandoning this world. No regrets. Why?
I am doing a favor to my crush and myself. Yet it still hurts I can't fall asleep. How does this make any sense? How strong is fictional love? Who is making me feel like this? I want to escape this hell. I already have crippling thoughts about my future and this just keeps coming up to me and it's so bad. So so bad.

Wondering late at night,"It is midnight and I cannot sleep again. I cannot remember the last time I slept through the night. I sleep in tiny spurts throughout the day but can never stay down for long. I often have nightmares even when I do stay sleeping for some time.

The other night, for example, I woke up screaming. I had been dreaming that I was eating a bowl of cereal and looked down and my spoon was covered in spiders. I actually like spiders so I am not sure why it scared me so bad. My husband reached over and held my hand and shushed me until I calmed down. It seems like he is too good to me always. I feel like I don't deserve it.

Tonight I looked outside the window at the world as I often do throughout the day. I thought to myself: the people that I have met, all of them, all of the people I have come across... does anyone of them ever think of me? Ever? Do they ever wonder how I am? Even just for a second? If they did, I wish I knew, because I feel like a shadow living life alone inside my house day after day. 

At the same time I feel that I am unworthy of friendship, community, love. Today at therapy my therapist asked me my goals. I said... to have a friend and to be a part of a small community that truly cared for me. But I have never felt or experienced that. I only know what friendships and loving communities are like from observing others.

Something is wrong with me,"I'm not one to reach out to strangers for help but something is wrong with me. I've felt empty for a long time now but I always contributed that to a lack of motivation.

 I fill this void so to speak with temporary pleasures like women, sex, working out regularly, and winning in games but they're all just distractions

Today I woke up and I was just sad and I don't even know why. I'm usually able to hold such feelings back but I woke up at 3am in the morning after going to bed a almost 1am. I was absurdly hungry and made some eggs and I just started crying. I just sat there eating these damn eggs with tears streaming down my face. There wasn't even anything wrong, I shouldn't be sad and yet I feel lower than I ever have. I've got a good family, plenty of friends, a job that is adequate for the time being, and I'm reasonably good looking to my knowledge but it's never enough. No matter how much I improve physically, no matter how much I win at DBFZ, no matter how many woman say I'm hot at the end of the day I still just feel empty.
Now I'm not here claiming to be depressed without even seeing a doctor but I don't like this. It seems like the only time I'm happy is when I'm in a relationship, but needing to constantly use a girl as a crutch to justify my existence isn't much better than being miserable by myself. I don't even enjoy life anymore I'm just going through the motions because I have to.

I don't know what to do and it frustrates me. I'm by no means suicidal but I'm tired of feeling tired. Every morning I wake up after 3 or 4 hours of sleep and lay there doing nothing. I feel useless and undesirable, I go on tinder and maybe I'll have a match or two but they just bore me with their monotonous bios and questions. It's not like I'm on there being toxic I do my best to make conversation but the thoughtless, close ended responses these girls send me annoy me and I just drop them.

I just want to feel content but I'm not even sure if I remember how. I know I'm not the only one who's ever felt this way. what did you guys/girls do to fill this hole I guess.",Yeetimus-Pr1m3,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdtam4/something_is_wrong_with_me/

Your typical normie trash with depression. :):,"I can't even tell when it all started, my memory has been very fuzzy past few months.So let's say 3-5 Weeks ago I *think* I feel in love for first time, I was 19. She has boyfriend so I don't even want to see her. But there was huge problem for me every time i thought about love or something similar i wanted to puke, no joke I almost puked way too many times, but after few days life became normal like usual.

Now i'm 20, after my hb I just stopped caring, I was really good student didn't even skipped school. But now I haven't been to school for 1,5 weeks. And the puking is coming back for no reason, but not as strong as it was. I feel like I lost motivation, fun and how to smile, getting worse vision, it's hard to concentrate on one thing. I'am getting easily exhausted, walking  2x slower than I usually did. I'm oversleeping no matter if i go to bed early, I still oversleep school. Also I'm listening to the one song like crazy obsessed, because it puts me at ease for some reason, even when i met up with my friends I still listen to the same song. Even when I'm going to sleep I listen to the same music. Don't know if it helps me or does it makes it worse. I started smoking 1 pack of cigs in a day,  usually 1 pack of cigs lasted about 4-5days.

I feel emotionally unstable, like my eyes get teary for no reason.  


I think I have fever lately, and don't understand if it's hot outside or cold. 

Lately i been thinking it would be nice to not feel anything, like lock all the feelings, emotions. And have peace. If u know how to lock emotions tell me ;3

I have suicidal thoughts, bcz i'm ur typical normie but i'm hanging there by small thread, I don't have courage to do something to my body.

I don't even know why tf i'm writing here. Oh, I think I know why am I writing here. Wanna be my friend? that could backstab so it would help cut that tiny thread, or ignore this post like usually i'm ignored which would put more weight and that thread wouldn't be able to support the weight.

I had ""depression"" 1-2 years ago, talked to my bestfriend made it better and it was gone not long after that. but that was like lvl 1, now i feel like it's lvl 5. Oh u say talk to my bf agian, but last night when I went to him I was afraid to show my back, when he let me go first inside.

I don't wanna see any doctors, because if i actually had depression then it would only make it worse. (like totally im not afraid of seeing docs... I wouldn't even know where to go)

"I’m having a personal crisis so I’m gonna write to the Internet, hey welcome to my ted talk . 👋🏼","I hate my life so much I question why I’m even here sometimes , like what’s the mandatory policy to life? which way should you go? well when ur born everyone tells you the ideal path in life. Go to school, Get a job, Settle down, Start a Family and so on ... well I’m a fucking piece of shit and already started fucking up my whole life and I wanna take it back I mean for god sake I don’t even have someone I can express this crisis too I gotta go on the Internet and spill my heart out to feel content with how I’m feeling and I’m feeling fucking overwhelmed. like no one cares right? no dude, no one fucking cares and that’s when I go back to my first statement why am I here anyways? to do drugs, to have an abusive “boyfriend” that can give less of a fuck when u wake up in the middle of the night crying because you’re overthinking everything you scared yourself wide awake? Because no one should even care in the first place, but what’s a life that’s so empty no one can even comfort you? but again that’s life no ones suppose to actually give a fuck about you all you got is yourself and when you realize that it gets even more lonely. I’m to the point where I’m scared of life and don’t wanna live it but scared of what happens when it ends anyways. What if I die without really living out my full potential because I already lived it out ? was my purpose so little I didn’t even get to realize it before I died? I don’t know I just know life isn’t easy but no one said it was, it just looked that way when things were easier, when people still cared and the world seemed so curious there were a million possibilities life could take you but now you just worry away because all the people the cared are gone and now all the curiosity went away because you’ve seen all the ugly in the world and nothing looks beautiful anymore. maybe I’m just depressed and can’t ever really be happy ? I haven’t felt genuine happiness without drugs in such a long time maybe I’m defective. I don’t even think anyone cares enough to even read this much but if you did and you’re reading this thank you for hearing me out this actually helped a bit.",aphrodite-rose47,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fds8vu/im_having_a_personal_crisis_so_im_gonna_write_to/

I feel unimportant.,"Not the first time I'm going through this of course, but recently it hit really hard. Like everything. I'm feeling extremely sad and tired. I want to die. Like genuinely. I feel like my life on this earth is insignificant and useless. I'm realizing I'm not happy with myself. I try to change but no matter how much I do, I can't seem to feel happy....about anything. My friends are disappearing one by one, school is getting harder and harder by the day, my anxiety has entered its way into mind, and dark thoughts cloud over anything bright. I just can't. I want to die, but I also fear what will happen after. I'm scared that maybe in the future things will get better, but because I'm dead I'll miss out. But also keep asking myself why does that matter? And the crazy thing is...my life isn't bad. Because even if I lost a few friends in my life, I also still have a lot of good ones. I have a lovely mother that cares deeply about me. I have some kind of passion that keeps me driven. So do I feel down. Because mentality, I'm unhappy. Because my friends don't trust me to tell me important things. Because I love my mom, but I want to get back on good terms with my dad to. Because I have passions yet I can't seem to pick up the pencil and write, draw, dream.  I hate this feeling. I wish I lived in my own world personalized just for me. It would be so much easier. I look at others and wonder what it's like to be like them. What is it like to be popular, associate yourself with everyone. What is it like to have a boyfriend and experience your first kiss. What is it like to have good grades in all classes. What is it like to be normal...I just want to feel worthy. I want to feel important. I want to feel genuinely happy in my life. In all honesty, I'm just really lonely. Love from your parents are great, but love from the people around you like your friends are so much more to me. Like it's expected of parents to love their kid(s), but when a friend loves you, it means something. At least for me. I'm 9th grade, only 14. I have so many years ahead of me that I'm looking forward to. But I'm always looking back on the past and never wondering or dreaming about the future. 

God....I hate myself. I want to laugh but cry at the same time because of this rant. So many mixed emotions...

This is unfair,"(I'm not a native english speaker, sorry for all the grammatical errors) 

I feel like I'm a fucking idiot and that the only reason I succeeded at school was because I was working hard, until now. I'm in my first year of college and the second semester started about a month ago but I feel like everything is falling appart. Two teachers barked at me while strongly implying that I was fucking dumb, I studied for several hours for a test and I ended up failing miserably while most of the class (who didn't study at all) found the test super easy. The worse thing is that the place I'm studying at wasn't even the one my high school teachers recommended me to go, thinking it was ""too easy"" for me, but I went to study here anyway because I felt like I wouldn't psychologically handle the option my high school teachers were recommending me to go to (in fact the day before my math finals in hs I was paralyzed on my bed for more than 30min and couldn't stop cyring thinking I wouldn't pass it despite the days I spent studying it). So currently I feel like that I'm just a dumb idiot and that everyone else is simply smarter than me, and the sole reason as to why I succeeded until now was because I cared about my grades but many didn't. I don't know what to do, I don't even know if I even deserve to post something here, I find myself ridiculous and I'm starting to skip meals.",its_me_templar,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdu6xw/this_is_unfair/

I feel like I have been LARPIng as ok - will SSRIs help?,"Basically I’ve always been a little listless and sad, even in elementary school. I got ok grades, didn’t really excel at sports. I started getting really great grades in college and joined a magazine, volunteered for the local Democrats, had a barista job etc. But still, even when I was seen as “ok” I was miserable. But, I have a lot of friends, I am kind and funny and have a nice time speaking to people. 

Now I’m three years out of post grad and I’m really suffering. I have been a poor performer at every job I’ve done post grad from the internship, agency, to the tech job I have right now. I have been put on a 30 day performance review and probably getting fired.

I don’t know what I want to do. I don’t know why I make these mistakes and fuck up my entire life. I feel like I’m broken, how will I ever make money?? I’m really on my own. I have rent and bills to pay. I could get another job, but I can’t deal with sucking and getting fired at the next one. 

I am on Prozac now so I am hoping this will help. I feel like being up for being fired was a wake up call. I am so ashamed I let this happen.

Someone killed my dog and I’m tired,"I’ve been posting here a lot recently, but it’s better then bothering my friends which is why I have. I feel bad because it probably seems like I am searching for some kind of attention, but I’m not I’m just so depressed and done with everything that I have no where else to turn. I used to text those crisis hotlines, but they never help anymore. They’re all trained to recite the same things, and it’s aggravating having the same conversation over and over again where it doesn’t really feel like my feelings are really being validated. 

Everyone goes through things. I know that as much as the next person. The world is a cruel yet charming place filled with a mixture of amazing people and people who couldn’t give two shits about others. I hate how complicated the world is, and I hate how the good things people do never seems to lessen the bad things. I have turned into such a cynical person and as time goes on I’ve found it harder and harder to see good in the world past some amazing friends and the unconditional love that animals provide. After someone killed my beloved dog though, everything just feels bleak again. He didn’t deserve the death he got, and it angers me that nobody even wants to put in the time to find out who would have done this to my best friend. “It won’t bring him back”, you’re right. It won’t, but maybe it would settle this raging anger I have inside? Maybe it would help me feel less guilty about the fact I wasn’t there for him because I was too busy fucking around in college? He gave me everything, and I gave him loneliness while someone brutally murdered him. 

I can never understand why I feel this way, and why everything in my life is going to shit. I’m so very tired and done with the world. When my mom died March 2019, I thought that was what finally broke me, but then I started to get better. I went to counseling, I leaned on my friends, and I started to cope better. I honestly thought that everything was finally looking up, but the world likes to put people like me back in their place. The more I think about it, the more I consider the fact that I’m probably meant for misery and this is why the world constantly kicks me back down when I start to get back on my feet. Coming home for spring break was a mistake as well. My father has done nothing but make me feel worse inside, and I have done nothing but be a recluse in my room watching Netflix. I have started to draw away from my support system too, not because they’ve done anything wrong but because I am tired of bothering them and they all have their own things going on in life without me coming around to be the depressed sack of shit that I am. 

I wish I hadn’t failed my suicide attempts in the past. I wish I was selfish, naive, and brave enough to try again. I wish I didn’t feel these things inside. Everyone would probably be better off without me anyway. My mom would be alive, my sweet baby would be alive, because I guarantee it was karma towards me that took them away.

I'm fine became an instant response,"Hello everyone. I'm sorry for taking your time, but I need help. 

A bit of a back story to my life: I come from a not-so-well-off family, mom left me (9at the time) and my sister (14 at the time)in my father's care (she left the country), to earn more so we could at least have a bread on the table. My sister took her frustrations on me, was being bullied at school gor not having a functional family, my father distanced himself from us... life generally sucked. I was also getting (at the time undiagnosed) migraines, which my sis and dad kept insisting that I'm lying about for attention, was even punished for it. So I stoped talking. After a long 2 years, my mother had applied for divorce, mainly due to my father's threats and mental abuse. By what I saw, my father was threatening my mother to throw me and my sis in the streets if she didn't send more money. The divorce was messy and a lot of shit throwing at eachother. It ended with my sis insisting that we need to stick toghether and since she was older, she insisted that we stay in my home country with my dad, also to spite my mother, who she now hated. The next years were rough, a lot of screaming, bullying, hitting, starving... list is long. (Just on a side note, I ended up climbing trees from windows to grab aome nasty fruit for my class mates and trading them and homework for sandwiches. Did I care I was millimeters away from dying, NAH!) Highschool was worse with the bulying, mom was still away but now, she had someone (she met the guy before the divorce, but I can't blame her. She was alone in a country where my people were, and still are, very hated). We tried to get mom to get cuatody of me, but for reasons I still can't wrap my head around, it failed. Well, her (now) husband lost his crap, and kept repeating to me and making me feel like pure shit because the process failed. It did fail because of me, yes, but as I said previously, I still don't remember why I said what I said and what happened. Years later, they decide to go to a better place, Australia! After 4 years of struggles and 3 lost cases, I finally get to get my (20 y/o) ass there with my mother. I get a boyfriend, her husband turns out to be the dickhead of the year and, long story short, I get kicked out of the house after only 1 year living with them, and end up with extremely severe anxiety because of him.

This year I turned 24. I still live with my boyfriend, who took me in. But here is where the problem is. I want to end it. So much stuff is going on, and all I can say is that it's too much. I was diagnosed (discovered by accident) with clinical depression at the age of 16, and was never addressed. I always felt like something was wrong, but every time I tried to look for help, was told to suck it up by the counselors and psycologists (admittedly, I only worked the courage to go 3 times in my life).

But in the past 3 years, I felt lost. I've been depressed and can't seem to get over it. I find no joy in life or any of the things I used to love. I have no reason, energy or motivation to move on. I drive to work, I work, put a fake smile, drive back, sleep, agrue, sleep, repeat. I feel so angry all the time, I ended hating myself more than ever, and I don't know why! I feel my partner is not there, he's stuck in his games and not engaging, and I think this is because I put too much pressure on him. I can't see my mother to talk to her, my sister doesn't talk to me and I had to go full no contact with my father. And whenever anyone asks me how I am, all I can do is repeat ""I'm fine"" and smile. I hate it... I hate it all....

Sorry for putting this all out, but I had enough of this. I want to smile, to enjoy things, but I can't... I need help. I knew I had to write this after I watched some reddit reading and was crying like an idiot at how accurate and true the things said in said reading were (the topic was ""What do you wish more people knew about depression"")

Grief Therapy/Process Group,"Another thing. My mom recommended I consider a grief therapy group or just a normal therapy group. I don't think I'm still grieving but I might be. I was in a process group many times, but I only sometimes felt okay with it.

Some of the others had an idea of what I deal with, as far as crippling depression and at the time, a bad home life. But they didn't have DID or BPD. At this point it's either one 🤦‍♂️. And the therapists, it didn't seem like they really knew how to help, like maybe they have had a personality case before but not on my level. 

I'm actually considering getting back into a group. Who knows, maybe this time they can actually help. I'm trying to not be so closed off. That's how it gets worse. Start shifting personalities and when I interact with my mom or anyone calling me, it's me but not me. Hope that makes sense.

I know you’re beautiful, happy or sad, excited or angry. You’re the most beautiful person to you, you want to know why?

I'm so inconsistent on what I can and can't do. I feel like a liar.,"I can do errands and generally go to work. I can make myself go to therapy for now. I'm exhausted the whole time, and it's hard to concentrate, but I can do it. I will admit I've called into work 7 or 8 times this year though. I usually only call in once or twice a year. Whoops. 


So I can generally do what I need to do. I can't cook or maintain my personal hygiene though. I've just been microwaving leftovers that someone else made or eating fast food. I haven't showered in 4 weeks. I only brush my teeth once a day, and even then it's half-assed. I haven't brushed my hair in a few days. I lay around when I'm not running errands/working/going to therapy and it makes my body sore as hell.

I want to get better and I need advice. (Text wall alert),"29M. Depression and OCd. Started off 50mg Sertraline 3 weeks ago for two weeks; raised to 75mg one week ago. 

Dear mods, if this is not the right place, kindly let me know. If would be great if you could direct me to the right subreddit.

English is not my first language so please bear with me.

**TL:DR**
I have done a lot of reading when I procrastinate from work. I want to start a daily journal on reddit to keep track of my positives and negatives, my progress, and hopefully get advices on when I go wrong. 
I noticed that I get overtly stressed over tiny chores/work/things to do, and I'd like to tackle it via progressive increase in exposure and desensitization. Then incorporate other CBT techniques.

***Story/Background:***

I have only recently been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder after a close friend forced me to. Looking back now, I think I first had mild depression around 16yo.
I recall having a general apathy towards life, results, ambition, family, and friends. Any motivation is fleeting and I'd spend most of my days daydreaming. Perhaps hoping for some catastrophe in the school so that I'm no longer bored.
The depression seemingly subsided - at least I think so - as I continued on aimlessly on some path my family/culture/friends expected of me. while I'm not excelling, I'm not underperforming. I have close group of friends and we enjoy movies and outings.
It all went to hell when I was around 22/23yo. I should add that I have Contamination OCD and during my University days, decided against my better judgement that I should live with a close friend.
This proved horrible as my OCD meant I couldn't live normally or telerate their habits. I thought I had it in control and hid my oddities well. I didn't. 

My housemates at the time hated me and talked loads behind my back. All the while I was oblivious about their hatred towards me while they acted normal around me. I noticed somewhere around 3 months in. I had the chance to look through their messages and curiousity started my depression.
Reading through all those hate filled complaints and messages was painful. Having to sleep in the same room as him after was impossivle. To act civil while I moved out was tough. While we did not have a big fight because we both hated confrontation,
our 6year friendship fell apart; along with it, I resolutely cut ties with the entire group of friends that was associated with this guy. 

I believe this to be the ""event"" which kickstarted my depression. Worse still, I moved to a different place and had another falling out with another group of housemates. We started off great, even went on a trip together. In about two months, I don't recall the cause of it. But I remember they confronted me on something and I just started withdrawing from them. 
After that, I stopped going to lectures and classes. I was fired from my club because I couldn't perform anymore. (I spent the first year making it into the committee), As a result, I graduated with a subpar GPA. I've never felt worse. I feel like I disaappointed my dad, wasted his money, and failed to prove myself to those who looked down on me.
I spent the next two years isolating myself in my room, only going out for groceries if I absolutely have to. I avoided the housemates by being active at odd hours. I lied to my family that I was trying and failing to apply for jobs while the truth is I mindlessly watched seasons after seasons of brainless TV. 
I am eternally thankful that my dad supported me through this lie. He paid for my rent, food, and courses I took because I wanted to extend my visa. Oh, I was also an international student so you can imagine how much money that costed. 
I cannot begin to describe the amount of guilt I feel. 

The reason I'm even trying to get better is because of guilt. My main motivation is to make them proud of me.

When I was 27, I spent a year dodging their concerned calls. They were so worried they sent a friend over to check on me. And finally, they took a flight over themselves. My visa finally expired and I went home.
After getting home, I once again lied to them about job searching and spent a year doing my best to avoid family events and outings. Finally, last year they forcefully got me a job with my relatives and I've feel into a routine since then.
I majored in Finance and Accounting in Uni. But my results were subpar and it has been 3-4years at this point. I barely remember a thing and I can't perform. I can't even get myself to pick the knowledge back up. 
Admittedly though, the work I perform doesn't require that much. But alas, I fail to perform. I find it difficult to get myself to issue a simple invoice which takes 5muinutes tops. 

I am more and more disappointed in myself over time. I hate the job, but I haven't even sent out a single resume. The very thought of going for interviews and exposing myself as incompetent frightens me. GEtting judged by anonymous HR people makes me hate myself.
I contemplated all kinds of alternatives ie: getting a remote part time job so that I can make extra income while improving myself. Taking courses online and hopefully put me ahead of others.
Ultimately though, I have not brought myself to do any of those things. Even this reddit post took 5days of contemplating before I could do it.

I know what I should do, and people will say ""you never know if you never try"" but I can't help but imagine the negatives. Posting for help on reddit for example opens me up to judgement from random strangers, trolls, even scams, some of them incredibly damaging. 
Improving myself via courses/books/lectures can be an enormous time sink. Not to mention that what is learned may not even be useful to me in the future and may end up being a waste of time.
Currently, I spend the measly 4 hours of free time I get after getting back from work watching movies or reading novels. They're not entertaining nor boring, but they keep me sane. I dread the day that they are taken away. 


***Analysis:***

Growing up, I've been instilled with the idea that I am smart, but lazy. I believe this became a part of my core identify. I'm 29 and I don't recall ever working hard, for anything. 
I've coasted through life however, largely because my parents made me go to numerous additional tuitions, cram classes, etc. I've never done homework, mostly copied them off of friends, but have the concept repeated to you enough times and it gets carved into memory.
My results up till 15yo were always above average. 

I believe due to the circumstances, I grew up without developing any self-discipline skills. Never having an aim or goal and simply going through the motions meant I was lost the moment those guidance were taken away. Believing myself to be smart also creates a subconcious anxiety - what if I worked hard but still failed? that would mean I'm not smart.

Throughout life, I have had a panic attack twice. Once when I was 10. An art project which took me 20minutes tops was criticised and I broke down in tears and hyperventilated, having to be taken home from school.
The next was when I was 16. Around this time, I was getting progessively more apathetic at school. I struggled to get up in the morning and was often late to school. I was late for 10 times and my parents were called to school which resulted in me hyperventilating once again.
I also spent a lot of time gaming which I believe was some sort of coping mechanism similar to mindlessly watching youtube or browsing reddit. 

Not entirely sure what these events mean. But I think I can conclude that I have an inability to accept criticism or face consequences of my own actions. 

***What I want to do:***

As stated above, I want to tackle my self-disclipline, responsibility avoidance, and anxiety towards work, via progressively increasing exposure. 
I will practice mindful relaxation and attempt to associate the relaxation with the trigger(work).
I will also journal on reddit. 1. To have accountability, 2. to further dissect my thoughts, analyze the issues, solve them. and 3. to get advice.

Rock Bottom,"So I’ve suffered some heavy depression for a long time, my ex that I absolutely loved to the max just got along so well, she was so gorgeous, caring, loving and nice. She was the first girl I actually loved in a long long time. Me and her were so good for each other I thought. She knew I was suffering from depression but the crazy part is every day I was with her I was improving. She was the support I used to slowly walk up the steps to getting better. I was happy as can be to have a girl like that and for myself to climb out of that depressed hole I was in for so long. Well we got into an argument before our breakup because I thought we were being pretty distant and she blew up. She told me “I just can’t handle it anymore” and left me, I was heartbroken. She couldn’t handle my depression anymore and that’s what hurt the most. I loved her with my whole heart and now she looks at me like I’m some stranger on the streets. She never truly explained to me why everything happened and she won’t talk to me at all now. I thought I was making us stronger by opening up to her and having her help me but she never told me how much I was hurting her with my depression. She saw me improve so much and deciding to leave outta no where made no sense to me. Well here we are today, all that progress lost. I feel worse than I ever have in my life. It really fucking hurts to know the one person I loved most couldn’t handle me at my worst and left me to rot. I don’t even know what to do. I’ve deadass just been hooking up with girls at parties and drinking with my friends until I blackout. I don’t know if I can trust another girl with any of my emotions again or even trust myself to love someone again. I just wanted to give her the world but I ruined it for her and us.

No motivation in job related issues,"I would like to share my situation here presumming this has already been talked about a thousand times. First of all, forgive my English as it is not my first language (Im from Spain).

Im a 26 yo civil engineering, graduated in 2018 after 5 long years of hard study. Before this, I did a couple internships in civil engineering during college. The second one went pretty good and my boss actually wanted to hire me but I decided to leave to start the masters. After finishing it one year later and not finding any job, I ended up in an energy company, in the sales department, a field totally different than my educational background, where I stayed temporarily until I could find something in my field. The thing is, several months have passed and Im still here but also I found out I dont like this job, to the point that it has driven to a state of depression and unhappiness, but still here because of the money. The situation has been aggravated since I cant find anything else, resulting in a feel of no motivation to find other jobs and challenge myself to reach higher in life. Also, I feel that Im not as competent as I should be and that makes me feel bad too. Times is passing and Im still stuck in this conundrum with the pressure of no succeeding. I know this relies in the survival of the fittest and work hard concept but it seems to be more difficult for me. The only times I feel an extra shoot of happiness is when I practice sports or Im with my girlfriend/friends. But then this bleak mental state hits back again.

Wonder if any of you have experienced a similar situation and how have you dealt with it.

How I’ve been,"What started as a week phase(on and off) in September of 2019 has slowly becoming more and more permanent. My eyes feel tired, I feel physically exhausted. I can’t focus, I can’t find enjoyment out of guitar and video games (things I used to put hours a day into).  So now I sleep. I sleep in my free periods at school and I sleep when I get home at 2:30pm. I wake up around 8pm, eat and go back to bed. My dreams are starting to be better then my own life.

I went to the school counselor for help last week. All she told me was to tell my mom how I was feeling and go see a doctor. That is the hardest thing I can possibly do. She will think it’s her fault, similar to how she took my sisters anxiety problem, and I can’t burden that on her. I don’t know what to do.

So I’ve been suffering from depression on and off for years, I’m currently in an off cycle but feel kind of down/low energy but not enough for me to call it depressed. Anyway, I somehow completely forgot about music and haven’t listened to it for months. I commute on the bus, and I usually just sit and browse reddit, and when my bf drives me the radio is usually off because I get sensory overload if he tries to talk while the radio is on, so we usually just keep it off. 

Anyway, yesterday when I went in the car the Bluetooth function was on as I guess my bf was listening to his music on his way home from work, and it automatically connected to my phone and started playing my music. It was a song by the Jonas brothers (embarrassing) from like 2008, and it just made me so so happy and I started vibing so hard before I had to start work. I seriously forgot about music. I told him now that every time he drives me to work I should play my music to give me a quick happy boost before work.

Yesterday I was reminded again.,"Exactly a year ago, I turned up at my gf's (now ex) house. She wanted to be angry with me that day, she was walking towards me about to explode....

She forgot even why she wanted to be angry with me for, we went IKEA to look at new stuff for her apartment and then we went to a cafe in which I took a selfie of us. We were so happy and cute together. That selfie popped up on my one year memories.

Fast forward to now, we've been separated since end of October last year. She doesn't talk with me, she removed me from everything except Facebook. 

I am hurting every fucking day. I remember her, I remember all the good times we had, I remember the future plans we had with each other. I don't know exactly when she turned from loving me to leaving me. But I just wish she spoke to me about any concerns she was having. I made my mistakes too by not understanding exactly what she wanted. 

I just want that happiness we had a year ago. I just miss her so much. We both wanted to get married, but I told her, once I finish school or get a job, we will get married!

My birthday is Saturday,"As the title says, my birthday is Saturday. The past 20 years I've never had a good birthday. My Mom was never stable, and my birthday was no exception. She'd would either view my birthday as a burden or if I didn't react in a specific way to something she would do for my birthday, she'd act as if the world collapsed around her and make a huge deal about how I don't appreciate her and she's a bad parent. (Maybe I'm just un-greatful like I've always been told) Regardless. As far back as I can remember, I've never had a good birthday. I recall vividly having a birthday party as a child, no one wanted to really play with me at my party. And I tried to isolate myself at a table when the cake was being cut (it didn't go over well with my Mom, she scalded me in front of everyone).

 As birthdays go by, all I remember are sighs, moans, and groans whenever mentioned. Last year no one wished me a happy birthday (family yes, but if history shows they don't really care) my Mom said I should celebrate her on my birthday because she's the one that gave birth to me.
 Later on I went to a pub I knew I could get into, and tried to get drunk but could barley manage. I had never felt so alone in a room of people, and it's not like it's a place I'm unfamiliar with, I knew the regulars, the regulars knew me, we're all well aquatinted. Yet still, I had never felt more alone. I ended up contacting a mate that sells me pot and got high with my weed guy. He's the only person that genuinely wished me a Happy Birthday outside my family.

 Flashforward to present day, life is pretty decent, my business is doing well, I have an album releasing soon, I have a clean bill of health (for the most part) but the realization set in...

My friend (we'll call him J) is talking in the group chat I'm in,  saying he wants to do social stuff soon, and I tell him that (we'll call him B) B and I are going to do stuff Friday and we could go out and do something all together. The chat goes cold. 

Time passes. 

Moments later, someone else in the chat (we'll call him C) says ""we should all do something Friday""...everyone lights up with agreeing with him. B then enters the chat and says my birthday is Saturday and ""we should be going out Friday for Matt"". C responds with ""that's fine"". Then everything hits me, I feel like a burden again, they probably didn't want to hangout with me, and now that B said something they feel obligated... 

I told them  ""We don't have to for me"" ""I would rather you guys have a full night"". The chats been silent since. I'm a burden, people probably hangout with me because they feel morally obligated. I'm just a waste of space.

 I'm probably being over dramatic and acting like a child seeking attention. But I know this post will waste away in the void. Nothing is genuine. I'll always be lonely.",MattMan2k17,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdq3xc/my_birthday_is_saturday/

[Advice please] I feel like I'm stuck in fog and I can't work out which way to go,"Hi, 

First post on this sub in a while but I'm at a loss of what to do

I'm so fed up of feeling numb and tired and like I don't want to exist and my brain is so fogged that I cant think straight

I'm trying everything - taking the pills, doing the therapy, seeking advice and just nothing seems to be helping

I don't like my job, but I also don't want to resign without anything else lined up and all of the experts and forums and advice systems just suggest trying to 'think in a more positive manner' and I'm really trying but it just feels hopeless, I get 5 minutes of 'maybe this will be OK!' then immediately back to the grey reality

I've started applying for new jobs as my current manager has suggested that we get through year end then if I'm still feeling the same way then perhaps I should look elsewhere

so I kind of don't see the point in actually trying until year end as if I'm not staying then who am I impressing?

I have a 1:1 later so I guess I'll find out if it's time to leave

&amp;#x200B;

has anyone had this ? can anyone help?

sorry just a brain dump

cheers",Lauraraptor,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdsw3x/advice_please_i_feel_like_im_stuck_in_fog_and_i/
I’ve never had this painful/angry feeling more in my heart than right now,"I (20 m) may or may not have depression and if I do it’s very mild, however that being said I feel this pain because I messed up the future I had with the girl I seriously would’ve hand crafted. I was madly in love with her but long distance made it not work in the end, I don’t have a problem moving on, but what’s hurts more than the break up did is finding out within a couple of months she’s met another guy, flew to him, and is planning on moving in with him. This could’ve so easily been me and her it’s painful. When we were together in person I can easily say that was the happiest 2 weeks of my life. Now I get it most people will think “just find someone else” but like some others I assume I am extremely picky. And then people will be like “just don’t be as picky” and my response is I will never be as happy with someone if I settle for less. 

I’ve never been this unhappy with living, what are good tips for turning this around and being happy again?

19M Need Help Badly in Relationships,"Before I start I do got to say that I do not struggle with girls becoming interested in me since most of RateMe and many other places rate me at about 7.5-8 out of 10 for a male which is about average.
My main problem is keeping their interest in me.
A little background on me, I don't have many hobbies,dropped out of HS because of social anxiety and deppression,fathers dead,still living with mother, have no car nor license,and have no motivation whatsoever. So my life's a mess. 
So compared to most my age I'm lacking in pretty much everything, especially confidence. No friends really, so I'm mostly alone and feel like dying.
Thats why I came here, I need advice and need it bad because soon I'm afraid I'm going to hurt myself because this pain keeps breaking me down and down and I don't know where to turn.

How do I deal with parents that basically just punish me for being depressed?,"Because I am so tired of this shit. I've tried to sit them down and explains syuff to them. It didn't work. Never works. 

They don't outright say that they're punishing me because I'm depressed, but the things I do or don't do because I'm depressed get punished. I have bad grades, I'm failing in almost everything. I'm trying but with depression is really hard. You know what I get for trying? My phone and videogames taken away. I can't fall asleep at night because of anxiety. You know what I get for having nightly panic attacks? Yelled at for ""staying up all night."" You know what I get for having trouble keeping my room clean? Grounded. 

Tommorow I'm losing my phone because my grades are bad. Ignore the fact that I'm trying, yeah let's only care about a damn letter of the alphabet because THAT makes more sense than a flippin living person! t(-_-  )t

I don't even like my phone that much. I'm not one of those people who are super addicted or nothing. But my phone is a coping mechanism. Without being able to vent or watch some relaxing video to calm me down I'm probably just gonna end up cutting myself.

"I might lose the only person in the world who truly loves me, my mom, and I don’t think I can go on without her...","My mom is literary the only person in the world who truly cares about me. For everyone else, I pretty much just exist in the background, or people just use me.

The past month or so, she’s been suffering with her own health issues, which have now grown so severe the doctors are almost positive it’s cancer or ALS. I’m trying to keep my hopes up that this is just some kind of short term problem, but every day it worsens, the more I can’t stop myself from thinking about the possibility of life without her.

I haven’t made any suicide attempts, but some nights I start thinking about how lonely I am. No one in high school liked me very much, lots of rumors would be spread about me. So after I graduated I didn’t keep many friends. I get it though, I’m boring. I don’t even daydream anymore about me living in a better mental state, surrounded by fun loving people. I thought it was stupid for me to live inside my head, so I stopped. But that was one of the things that would help me fall asleep better.

"I tried falling in love, now I'm even more broken","I'm 24 years old. I've consisrently failed at pursuing all my dreams. A year or so ago I broke up with my ex girlfriend. I met her 2-3 years ago, memory is getting foggy, I'm sure y'all understand. Before that I was lied to, cheated on by the few other girls I'd been with. She dropped into my life out of nowhere. I met her online and at first we were both apprehensive... I didn't want to get hurt more but she was there for me. She helped me see therapists for my disorders, she helped me get out of bed and go to work every morning. We lived in different timezones and she would stay up through the night to wake me up in the morning to hear my voice. I fell in love with her. She said she loved me too. I flew her to where I lived and she took two weeks off her work which she takes seriously. She maintained she loved me, things were even better than she had hoped. After she left everything started slowly crumbling. I was getting worse without her and she couldn't deal. She couldn't deal being away from me, according to her, and I could see my disorders were bringing her down, even when I was on antidepressants. She eventually broke up with me. And it's been a year, and I'm living with someone else. She's living with someone else too. I don't feel anything anymore guys... I just try to not cry every day. I'm not fucking happy. I miss her and we text occasionally, she knows what she wants, and it's not me. I've lost interest in even sex now, worse than with the SSRIs. I really don't know how to keep going.

"No matter which path in life I take, I will be unhappy","I don't know if anyone will even read this, but I need to vent somewhere. For some background, I am now living back in my home state, in an unhappy situation, because I wanted to come back and finish up school and so that I could be around my family.

Originally, I moved away for a few years. I was unhappy before I left my home, and I found real happiness out west in Colorado for a time. I began traveling around, working seasonal jobs at ski resorts and in national parks, and I really enjoyed it for awhile. I just wanted to keep traveling, but then the realities of life set in.

I didn't have a degree, I wasn't in any sort of high-paying jobs, and I was struggling to make it paycheck to paycheck. Despite all of this, I was still relatively happy. Eventually though, I realized that I missed my family and my old friends terribly, and decided to move back so that I could be around them and get an education.

Fast forward to now. I'm 26 years old, living at my dad's house, working in an unfulfilling job that pays terribly, while I wait for my first semester of school to start. I feel like an absolute failure because I won't even have a degree until I'm 30. I won't start my career until almost a decade after everyone else did. I miss what I was doing and the places I traveled through so terribly much. I feel like I'm missing a part of myself by being back here and I left it out west.

I have considered moving back, but I have no idea how I would afford it, and I don't see any career opportunities for me outside of dead-end, low paying jobs out there. Also, if I don't do school now, then I don't think I ever will. If I moved back out, I would just go back to seeing my family once a year for two or three days, and I love them so much. That was the hardest part of being out there, and I want to be able to see them regularly. I'm extremely close to my parents, and I don't want to miss a moment with them, because I realize that they will be gone some day. Every moment with them is precious.

But, I feel like I'm slowly dying here. I am turned into a depressed, cynical person who cannot see the good in life anymore. Everything is negative, and the people around me in this state are so ignorant and offensive. I don't belong here, and I don't know what to do. Grappling with this indecision has been so unbelievably hard on me.

If I stay, then I will just become more and more unhappy. If I leave, then I will never be able to see my parents, and I will be unhappy again because of that. I can't take it anymore. Looking ahead, my life seems like it is going to be one endless stream of depression and I honestly just want it to end.

Please, help me. I don't know what to do anymore and it feels like I'm going insane just battling with my own thoughts all day",psyinide388,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdovxe/no_matter_which_path_in_life_i_take_i_will_be/
Changing thought patterns via therapy different than wishing away depression?,"I have never understood the distinction between therapy like CBT which tries to train you to think more positively to reduce or eliminate depression, which is sort of the underlying belief of most psychology thinking, versus the sentiment that one cannot think themselves out of depression. 

Could someone explain to me how these two sides can reconcile with each other?",canon4242,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdrf07/changing_thought_patterns_via_therapy_different/

I (19M) feel like I'm reaching a breaking point.,"I've been feeling depressed af the last few months, it sort of feels like a relapse after about 6 months of a reasonably healthy mental state.

Basically I feel physically drained of energy all day, I have zero motivation to study or try in any way whatsoever in college. I'm doing a notoriously tough course and barely passed my Christmas exams. I come home exhausted but when I go to bed I just become really agitated and irritated. My heart starts pounding and I struggle to breathe, I can't get comfortable and even if go to bed exhausted at 8/9pm I wouldn't get to sleep until 2/3am.  However in the mornings I struggle so much to get out of bed, I feel like there's almost zero point getting up anyway as I wouldn't even miss out on anything. I end up missing so many of my lectures simply becuase I cannot bring myself to get out of bed. I still live at home going to college but if I lived by myself without parents I could see myself just staying in bed/my room for days at a time. 

Every day passes by in a sort of blur for me, I feel like I almost have a depersonalization disorder as I just operate in autopilot. I feel like a shell, it's almost like I'm just empty inside; I don't feel emotions, everything just feels monotonous and numb.  Honestly I really just don't give a fuck about anything anymore. I used to have passions like playing music/sport/reading/films etc but nothing excites me anymore. I feel like I don't really have an emotional outlet, it's like I'm just existing day-to-day without actually living. Since I find close to zero pleasure in general life I self-medicate with weed; I guess it's just a coping mechanism in order to feel something other than numb. I also think I have memory loss, as the last couple months have really blurred, I honestly don't know where the time has gone or what I've been doing in that time. 

I also have really really bad eating habits, I don't generally eat breakfast and then could go the day without eating. However when I come home I often would binge until I struggle to breathe. 

I also feel socially exhausted every day I have to go into college; pretending to be someone I'm not is mentally draining as I feel like I'm putting on a fake persona just to mask the numbness when all I wanna do is just go to bed/get high. This is probably part of the reason I avoid going to lectures. 

This all eventually caused me to go to the student couseling services in my college sometime last week, however I feel like I wasnt as honest as I should have been regarding my situation, I was definitely making it out to be less severe than it actually is. They set me up with counselling sessions that start in 3 weeks. 

However I feel like my ability to function has been severely impaired in the last few days. Tonight I felt the urge to self-harm for the first time and honestly if I had clean razors I would already have done so. I don't think I can wait 3 weeks for my counselling appointment, I feel like I should go to a GP/psychiatrist and see what they think. I feel like I just want someone to tell me exactly what I have, I'm 99% sure it's depression, and perhaps symptomatic  insomnia/a binge eating disorder. I guess part of me still denies it's depression despite me knowing that it almost certainly is and I feel like I need a medical professional to tell me how it is in order for me to be able to work on getting better. I guess I also want to see if they think that medication could help too. Ultimately I just want treatment as soon as possible, something concrete I can show to myself to tell me that I'm taking steps to improve myself as atm I feel so lost in life, and I feel like a breakingpoint might come soon unless I change things. 

I really don't know where to go from here, I guess this post is just a reflection. Maybe I just want to get my thoughts down somewhere but if anyone has any advice obviously I'd rly appreciate that: like most ppl here I just wanna feel normal again. :( If anyone would be willing to talk about things a bit more in detail I'd appreciate a pm.",taway0403,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdlr0n/i_19m_feel_like_im_reaching_a_breaking_point/
I don't do anything,"I've got a lot of work to do, but I can't do anything. The voice in my head says that even if I tried, I wouldn't get anywhere, I wouldn't succeed. That's why I always delay things, even though I have to do it at that time. The worst part is that I'm aware of this situation, and I'm still not doing anything about it. Time's going too fast and idk what to do. My anxiety gets worse at times like this and when it gets worse, I can't even sleep, let alone do anything.

Disappointed,"Disappointed
That's the one word I would use to sum up the way I feel. Disappointed in everything. 

Myself, for being...mediocre. That's the only word that comes to mind when I consider my life. I've been given so many gifts and people that love me, and I waste it all. I don't quite understand what's wrong with me, but I know there's something not clicking right in my brain. People talk about a certain fire behind someone's eyes, a drive that pushes them to work hard for their goals. I dont have that. I'm not passionate about anything. I find myself with no motivation to do anything, even doing days without eating. Some days I'll be how I used to, full of energy and making people laugh, but, as quickly as it appeared, it's gone. I'm back to laying in bed all day, not speaking to anyone, not doing anything that I'm not required to. The only thing that impresses me anymore is how easily I lie to my own family. As soon as they call, I become this other person. The person they want me to be, who does well in school and never had any issues. 

I don't feel joy anymore. Not a trace of genuine happiness, other than the aforementioned 'good days'. Even the things that used to make me happiest, like Christmas, now just seem annoying and pointless. I can't sleep, often laying awake for hours on end. 

Fuck, I miss him. I miss my Da. I would give anything in the world for 5 more minutes with him. He was everything to me, my whole world. I loved him with everything in me. You could come to him in the worst possible situation, and he would tell you what you needed to hear, and you would always come away feeling better. But now he's gone. He left, leaving a mess that my family has yet to fix, and now I'll never see him again. Never hug him, or hear his roaring laughter. I'll never again have him look me in the eyes and say ""I'm proud of you, son."" And that breaks my heart. Sometimes I go back and listen to old voicemails, just to hear his voice. 

I'm disappointed in my family, some more than others. We all came together as a family for the funeral, and not even 24 hours later they're already fighting. I don't understand what I have to do to let them know I need help. I shouldn't be too hard on them, but if my friend who hasn't seen me in 3 years can discern I'm struggling over the phone, surely my own family could tell. I told them I wasn't ready to go back, that I couldn't handle it, but they didn't listen. I've never once in my life had real freedom. Freedom to choose what I want. Thats not exactly true. Theres 2 options: do what they want, or be on my own. 

Disappointed in those around me. Now, I could never blame anyone here for my problems, but damn if they can't tell. There are people here who's job it is to identify people who are struggling. They haven't approached me, nor have any of my 'friends' here. I went to the counselor once, and after an hour of talking, he told me that he thought my Das death might have had an impact on me. No shit. Say what you will about my high school, but I'm more comfortable telling anyone there that I'm struggling than I ever would be here. 

I don't know where something went wrong, where I lost my drive, but I want to fix it. I want to be happy again, but every day that seems farther away. Every day, I feel less like myself and I just want it to end.",howdoiexpressemotion,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdrbq9/disappointed/
The only time when I feel fine is when I sleep,"When I am awake my anxiety is there every moment, and it can be overwhelming. I feel my heart beating faster and my breathing becomes a mess, I just feel my whole body feel uncomfortable when I am awake. The only time where I don't feel panic, where I don't feel as much negative feelings, is when I lie in bed and my mind is getting ready to sleep. I don't know how long it takes to fall asleep, but if it took 10 minutes, then those 10 minutes is the best I ever felt in the whole day. I know that its not good to sleep so much, but I understand why some people would choose to sleep a lot when they are depressed. I look forward to that peaceful 10 minutes.

I don't really think if one phrase could even describe how destroyed am I,"I don't even know how to start, I always thought about one thing that always tortures my brain: Everyone are the same, but I am not. When I was a child, being child was the perfect excuse to hide my condition: I don't know how to talk to people, I don't know how to prolong a conversation, I don't know anything about being sociable. In the other hand, I was (and I am) really smart, but I don't really qualify myself about something special, because people are so stupid to think about being self-centered, instead of thinking about the personality itself, that's maybe one of the thing I don't even comprehend about society, well I continue, being able to do whatever you want its something amazing, I felt (I feel) I got the most powerful superpower, being able to think about something interesting to do and make it real, make it like I was professional on something, but if you can't even talk, even express yourself, your brain, all of your amazing ideas are taking down to trash, to something miserable, how much kids, teens worried about the things other people say (I worry too), but I'm 100% sure they can shine if they are with the correct people, ask me, I'm 22 now, in 22 years, Why didn't I find anyone like me?, anyone who I can talk about interesting things and not about superficial and stupid things, anyone who takes the life like a poetry, with right values, anyone who understands me, anyone who I can be myself

I hated my school partners, and they always thought about things on how to ruin my day, I didn't understand why being so small, being so tiny they were so disrespectful to each other, I lived on a city that I can't even pronounce it's name because is the reason of all my misfortunes, people so damn vulgar, so damn low they can't even teach their kids how to be kind, how to be respectful to anyone. I learn about pride, that keep me away from bullying, they don't even know why they bullied me, bullies tend to attack people about their body, about if they are stupid, about a condition, they just attack me because it was me, and I know, they smell it like dogs, possessed maybe, because I didn't find a reasonable reason to understand what they bullied me, but in the middle of that, I thought why just can't we be friends? Why do we attack to each other? Only because I can't be vulgar like you? They is the reason why I hate my ethnicity, this stupid language called spanish talked only by freaking stupid people, because I learned about they, every single piece of word they say, why my country is infested with third-world-people, they are way too worried about lgbt and inclusiveness, why didn't they included me on society?

There was a guy, Alvaro C. was and still is his name, he was the most disgusting, profane, putrid and revolting person I ever met, he was just a compulsive masturbator, obsessed with pornography, I remember when he checked the teacher computer just for looking for sexual content, when he masturbates in class, I couldn't care less about his life except for one thing, he didn't let me breathe one miserable day when I was in school, he just looked for me to having some daily fun, let's make this piece of s**t even more s**t than he actual is he thought, I cried trying to understand why me? what did I got in myself that makes me so despreciable?, he didn't know about what thing inserted in my mind, now I'm him, now it's me who have a problem with porn addiction

When I was 14, I decided to play guitar, not only that, now I'm feeling that I'm able to put some music on the radio with some effort and money, but I don't have the energy left to do something, actually I just don't have energy to do nothing more than just laying in my bed and watching these repulsive videos that I hate, but I can't left behind for some reason, this thing is just consuming my brain, all my abilities, my smartness, my heart, my soul, I want to leave it but I'm thinking that I have no reason to do that, because for me now life is just pointless, is just about being stupid, thinking stupid, talking stupid, living stupid, don't try to be some special for this world because this world will take you and make you descend down to their level, descend down to hell, and if you make it to the top maybe it's because you are like they by default, I got ideas, still have some beautiful ideas, but I'm alone, waiting for someone to help me that will never come, suicide is just a boring option, I know if I just die no one will notice and I hate that, I will not take that option because I don't want to give them the pleasure of that, it's freaking hypocrite when these criminals of society cry to a fallen relative, cry is a emotion just for good people so you know now why they don't cry me but instead cry to themselves, you may not believe in God, but you can make sure the Devil is in one of us waiting just for destroy everyone else and every piece of you, disguised as everything you know, the more you think everything is normal, the more you are far away from comprehend that life, this world f***ing hates you, that's not a advice, that's what I understood in 22 years.",Diealrod,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdtbme/i_dont_really_think_if_one_phrase_could_even/

Save Me,"I... I can't imagine dying, it's not something that I want.

And yet these thoughts they still exist and seem to scare and creep and haunt.

Plenty of ways to go about it, some are easy, some are not.

I let the feelings fill me up till I become too deep in thought.





I'm standing on a bridge, I'm looking down at frigid water.

I have come here with a thought, and intentions of self-slaughter.

But when I stand up on the railing, I want someone to come,

Someone to shout and pull me down, stop me from doing something dumb.





I want a stranger's embrace, to reassure me it's okay.

To tell me that it isn't worth it, that the trip's only one-way

I want to bawl and breakdown, in the arms of the unknown.

So I can maybe feel cared about, and not feel so alone...





Now I'm in my room, with a note and rope in hand.

Thinking I'll finally fall through, let my thoughts and mind disband.

But when I step off of that stool, I want my mom to come rush down,

To pull me out my quiet guillotine, and stop my silent drown.





Oh, she'd probably hug and sob, knowing what I had tried to do.

Glad she ran down stairs to check on me, as if had been on cue.

That night would stay with her forever, make her always high alert,

To stop her child from disappearing, or end up permanently hurt.






However in both situations, I would simply end up dead.

That is, if I could follow through with all these thoughts that haunt my head.

This isn't a cry for help, I wouldn't accept any because I feel I should be able to get over my problems by myself.

I was diagnosed wish major depressive disorder at 15, then obsessive compulsive behavior at 23, with generalized anxiety coming in at 25. I know I cannot simply get over my issues because they're in my brain. I also know that it's all in my head, that's why they're called mental problems.

To get to the point, I'm lonely. I have like 3 friends, but I know if I had a girlfriend I would still be lonely. When I had one, who was amazing, I still was feeling alone. I really just think that it's all going so bad because I deserve it, and that it will make the good times seem better.

I'm not patient when it comes to my feelings. I want this feeling to go away more than anything. I've basically sheltered myself in my room for the past year and a half. I don't remember how to talk to people or act in public. I have a job, but only because I'm striving to not be homeless.

I'm sorry if anything I said upsets anyone somehow, I really needed to say something. I'm starting to lose the battle in my head again. I feel like I've been fighting it for much too long. I want to just give up fighting and give in to the sickness taking me over.

Tomorrow is my thesis defense and I am not doing anything,"I tried making progress on my thesis from a few weeks back but it has been so difficult, not just in a mental state. Ever since I got depression, I have the hardest time focusing on stuff. Even if I tried to focus on doing stuff I enjoy doing, I can't do it for long, my head gets dizzy. I can't read lines in a book without getting my vision blurry and end up forgetting which line I was supposed to read.

And I also have the hardest time to recall short term and long term memories. These days I would have lunch and half an hour later I would ask myself ""wait, did I eat lunch today ? or was it yesterday ? Do I need to eat again ?"". I can't tell which day of the week is it. I currently don't have the two things that are absolutely crucial for my productivity, which is concentration and memory. I try to bring myself up but it is so freaking hard when my body can't respond back.

I guess now I just have to do what I can and try to brace myself for tomorrow, for I am sure to be destroyed during my defense tomorrow. I am scared sh\*tless because I know one of the professors can be ruthless and heartless, can only imagine how heartbreaking it will be tomorrow. I want to pat myself on the back and say ""Its okay, its gonna be fine. You've done your best against all odds. If you fail tomorrow its fine, you can try again next time"" but I can't bring myself to do that, and I am scared and I feel alone. I just feel like I need a hug.",southwestperson,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdquqj/tomorrow_is_my_thesis_defense_and_i_am_not_doing/
I'm drinking myself to death and it is causing my family pain,"The reason I drink is to self medicate because I saw my friend pass away in a car accident when I was 19. We were both stupid and I challenged him to a race using our parents cars. Basically, he understeered into a tree. I have tried therapy but it didn't work for me. I was also diagnosed with PTSD and depression. I stopped taking my prescription because it didn't work for me. I feel that I have blood on my hands because I was the one who made him do it. 

My parents and grandfather came to me and told me that they were worried about my drinking problem. I sometimes drink a bottle of Vodka a day. I just want to drink myself to death. My granddad tried to relate to the situation by telling me about the things he was in Vietnam. I walked out because I was upset about everything. I now think that I was out of order and I would do anything to apologise. But at the same time, I feel that they shouldn't have bought my grandfather along because he is getting Parkinsons disease so I don't want him to worry about me as well.",Hlp4me,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdkyyj/im_drinking_myself_to_death_and_it_is_causing_my/

"I know this will get lost, but I'm just so tired of being alive.","Every day now for years, it's been exactly the same. Wake up, attend online school, get scolded by my teachers and parents for my poor grades and how slow I am, spend hours doing homework I struggle with, be overwhelmed and stressed about my life, cry, go to bed, and repeat. On the weekends I'll either just sit in my room all day watching YouTube or nap all day because I can't even find the energy to get out of bed and do anything. I can't even find the will to finish my overwhelming amounts of homework. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I don't have any skills, talents, or interests, and I can't even get a job since I live in the middle of nowhere and I'm terrified of learning to drive. I don't even really know anything about the real world. I'm just a husk of a person who rots in isolation in my room all day fantasizing about dying. I am so desperately alone and I feel like a absolute worthless moron. My entire life I've never even had one friend to talk or confide in. Every time in the past when I was going to public school and tried to make friends with people I always fucked up and made myself look idiotic because I never understood how to talk to people and form connections with them. I can't even make online friends. No one cares about me, not even my own parents. Every time I try to have a conversation with my mom, (who is the only thing keeping me from not being totally socially isolated as I am pathetically desperate just to have someone talk to me since I have no one else) she doesn't even bother to pretend to listen to me. She has more important things to do than spare a moment of her time talking to me. I get it, but I wish she didn't make it so obvious. 

I just am so tired of trying to survive each day of hell by myself. I don't see how life can get any better when I'm already incapable of achieving anything. It doesn't help either that I'm so scared about the future. I don't know what I want out of my life, and even if I did, I'd have no idea how to get there with how far I've fallen behind everyone else and how unmotivated I am. I'm scared of fucking my life up even more than I already have. Maybe it'd be easier at this point for me to just drown myself to prevent having a depressing future where I'm suffering even more. I don't really know.

"i dont hate myself, im fine i just find life to be pointless and nothing excites me anymore","first of all let me say i dont have a problem with myself, im good the depression isnt about anything personal. my thing is more existential. human beings have  made great leaps in the last hundred years which when you think about it is just a speck on calendar. as far as movies and music to me it just seems like every song has been written and every tvshow/movie has been made and we as a species are just kind of going through the motions. to add to this is this innate sense of self destruction that humans have, its hard for me to put into words but it seems like we have come to do what w need to do and our time is probably up. i mean how many times can we see the same movie (franchise reboots anyone) or the same songs as we run out of original melodies on top of other factors such as a.i and world friction. to me it seems like we are just tapering towards an end and id rather it not be som long drawn out song and dance. im not sure if that makes sense but thts how i could verbalise in a way my feelings",cuechtritz,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdon5y/i_dont_hate_myself_im_fine_i_just_find_life_to_be/

It might not make sense to a lot of people but it really gave me perspective and made me feel a little better!,"I had a thought today while I was mulling over what a shitty mood I’ve been in lately.

And it just popped into my head that maybe that’s what happens when we get thrown back into depressive episodes- maybe someone has been feeling so shitty for such a long time that the universe has decided to give them a break and I’m the one that’s been chosen to “take the shift”, bearing some heavy emotions, etc. And that when I’m lucky enough to have some free time for an afternoon snooze or just to watch a movie, someone else is taking my “shift” for a while.

What does it mean when you feel so sad/lost/hopeless, but none of your friends or family seem to notice? To be constantly around people, but to feel so alone? To feel like you're being sucked into this black hole, but no one is around to help you out? To not really know how you feel? To wishing you were brave enough to tell other how you're feeling? To reach out for help? But at the same time, feeling hurt because nobody seems to care? To want someone to look into your eyes and see the sadness and tell you it's going to be okay? For the ones 'closest' to you to hear the lie in your laugh? To feel alone? Abandoned? Like you'll never be happy again? To be so scared that you'll feel this sad and lonely forever? Sometimes I really wonder if there is a single person out there that cares about my feelings, about my health, about my state of mind. I try so hard to be shoulder to cry on for my loved ones, to be a support system. But what about me? I've spent my whole life putting other people's needs before my own, and now that I'm trying SO HARD to focus on myself and put my needs first, I'm alone. Even the few people I've shared my feelings with are nowhere to be seen. What's the point in sharing if nobody cares? Because nobody cares, right? I think it's pretty obvious at this point. So what do you do when you have no support system?  No one in your corner to encourage you? To fight for you? To fight FOR you? When there's no one to tell you 'it's going to be okay'? To give you a hug while you cry? Because you're always crying. I don't know. I just want my smile to be real again.",04sabdi,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdpjop/emotional_hurricane/

And everyone keeps telling me how ""nice"" and ""good"" I am at my job such as winning a rather ""employee of the month"" sorta thing but as strange as this seems....

I struggle to believe them. Now of course I'm not calling them liars I just find it to hard to believe. I know that sounds rather stupid but I honestly just can't help feel this way.

As I said I truly love my job and everyone there but that is honestly where most of my self esteem comes from so constantly thinking I'm horrible at it is obviously not a good cycle.

Now as for everything else apart from my job, well I will just break it down like this:
I'm at overweight, ugly, shy, embarssing and awkward guy that honestly anyone could cringe at talking to. And of course I'm trying to overcome some of these things like the overweight part but...I'm honestly losing hope at this point and it's giving thoughts of doing something silly to my self.

Sorry about this silly dump of self pity but I actually couldn't think of what else to do.

26 and feeling so burnt out,"Long story short.. I've been in and out of college, failing out two different times taking breaks from classes once or twice. I've had on and off addiction problems with alcohol during this time.. basically I've been trying to get a bachelor's degree for 7 years. The last 4 years of college has caused me soo much stress. My parents are wealthy and not to say they are at fault in any way for my failire but they have sort of enabled me financially  to keep trying to get a degree. Ive wasted probly around $100,000 dollars on failed/withdrawn classes. My sister deeply resents me for this. I have an insane amount of guilt for this too even though my parents say they would pay anything and help me in any way they can for me to graduate. 

So after all that, i made it to my final semester b4 graduation. Im only taking 2 classes but i might fail 1 of them and that would result in my 3rd and final academic dismissal, meaning i wount get a degree cause of a flunk in my final semester. I just dont understand why i cant just sit here and do my homework and actually care. My problem is i dont give a crap about anything unless i have an innate desire or interest in it. Like my motivation is just 0 in anything thats academic i dont understand why!

So after all this.. even if i do pass and graduate i feel like im so broken, endured so much stress by the age of 26 that i feel like just a vegetable now.  i cant fathom myself using my business degree to get a ""real job""  i dont know if ill ever be able to get over the idea that i spent over 250,000 dollars on a degree and i have no desiree to work a normal job because i feel like my brain is this empty void that only seeks pleasure and has no purpose or drive. On the surface, im a happy bubbly person. Im outgoing and very sociable. I feel deep down i really have alot of potential but im soooo lost and so easily overwhelmed by everything. I feel the slightest bit of resistance and i just shut down mentally and seek pleasure in the form of leisure activity or alcohol. 

Idk where im even going with this.. sorta just letting it all out i guess because i have nobody to talk too. If you read this far im sorry for all the grammatical errors i just typed it all out and didnt re read it once.

Why am I feeling uncomfortable for no reason?,"I think I have depression for over a year and recently I got a little better (I still have suicidal thoughts and still pessimistic often but I feel like I'm slightly better) but today I'm feeling something different. I usually feel a little of sadness mixed with numbness or numbness only but rn I can't explain what I'm feeling. I don't think there's something on my mind making me worried, I'm just feeling weird inside and I can't pinpoint what's the problem. Maybe my subconscious is stressed because of all the bad times and feelings I've been coping with all that time and I'm feeling the effects now? Or it's just a temporary feeling? Who knows?

Trapped,"Over the last few years, I've gone through various cycles of depression, anxiety &amp; panic attacks. I've fallen into the trap of everything's fine again i'm alright, only to be hit by a oncoming train of depression 6 months later. I spend a lot of time in my room alone &amp; I rarely leave the house much and when I do leave I feel massively anxious &amp; I feel much worse when dealing with people. I get hit sporadicly with depression &amp; insomnia, which makes everything so much worse. Insomnia has a truely wonderful talent of nuking everything.

I feel like I have no future and certainly no future or a life where i'm happy or even content. I've spoken to friends and loved ones about jobs and I always get the wishy-washy response of ""you'll be fine"" or ""everything will work out fine"". I want to have purpose in life but I just feel so incredibly hollow &amp; low all the time &amp; all my interests and hobbies just fade away. I'm absolutely terrified of applying for jobs (i've had a few interviews that completely nuked my mental health for more than a year) in fear that it's going to destroy my mental health again (had very bad experiences in my last job) and it doesn't help when friends/family tell me I need to apply or jobs or that i'm lazy. I really don't know what it is i'm suppose to do? or what it is that people think I should be doing? 

My biggest concern is that I just feel like if this is something I have to cope with for the rest of my life, I just don't think I'm going to be able to cope and I really worry where that will lead and what bearing it'll have on the important decisions in life. I'm really struggling to help myself and get help. Even writing this post has been hard (this is my fifth attempt) &amp; composing my thoughts has been really difficult. 

Has anyone had similar problems? or been in a similar situation and overcome it? I really don't want this but I feel like i'm stuck with it unable to do anything about it. I feel trapped, with nowhere to go.",kmanfred,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdl50q/trapped/
When I'm alone is when I'm most at risk.,"When I'm at work, I talk, laugh, and hide behind my shield. When I'm with family, I'm a little more vulnerable, but I'm mostly still silent about the things that are working hard against me to bring me down. However, when I'm alone...that's when it hits me. When my kids aren't home and I'm left to my own devices, that's when I'm the most afraid. It's not that I don't think anyone would miss me, it's the fact that I don't honestly care if they would or wouldn't. I feel like if they knew the extreme pain and mental anguish I'm in from the events my life has drug me through, they would understand my want for release. The constant cheating of exes, the constant deception and pain from being tossed away over and over again. The uselessness I feel of getting out of bed because the same vicious cycle awaits me every single day of my life! I'm tired. I'm tired of giving myself to others, putting myself out there and making myself vulnerable, just to wash, rinse, and repeat a thousand times more. Is it time for me to go? Does it matter?

Furiously Tired of “Running at it like a Bull”,"People are unrelatable and hindering to me at this point. I feel as if every time someone approaches me, or walks into my space, I can predict what they are going to say to me. This annoys me further.

Ive been fired from the last 5 jobs, all for reasons of using marijuana to calm myself from my co workers, or outright having a verbal confrontation which results in me getting fired. I used to like being around people, but as i reach the age of 25 i feel like i’ve been struggling for an eternity.

Im truly tired of this fucking 9-5 society everyone seems to be able to spend 40 years in and come out accomplished. It seems no matter how many counsellors  i appoint myself with, or how many doctors appointments im making nobody is helping me and i feel im reaching my breaking point. I know i cant live without society, but this cant continue.

Ive tried steps to help myself, counselling, therapy, doctors appointments; all leads back to the same bullshit place im in now, stuck in society. 

Ive recently acquired my second dui, have a breathalyzer in my vehicle and spend most days sitting at home thinking about how much i hate interacting with people.

The women my age ive dated and been around dont want to hear any of this. Men arent supposed to complain or whine. Im supposed to shut up, apply for another job, and continue to “run at it like a bull”.

"Ex bf is suicidal, depressed, and mentally ""not there"".. how to help?","I broke up with my bf about a year and a half ago, after being together 4 years. Throughout our relationship he was often depressed, angry at everything, narcissistic, extremely anxious, would go through phases of not eating, etc. I tried helping as much as I could and encouraging he get help (which he did a few times, on and off seeing a therapist) but it never worked.

I had to cut off our relationship because it just became ""too much"". He would blame me for his carelessness, would get annoyed if I offered help in any way, and was just constantly negative. I just often didn't feel loved, and without ranting his mental health issues were stressful as I tried and tried to help him and it felt useless.

When we broke up I didn't feel the need to block him but did not want to be ""friends"" or really ever have any communication any more. Since we broke up, he has texted me here and there that he's suicidal, hates everyone, screams at himself, has no reason to live, etc. He told me that since I broke up with him he would kill himself, but i took that more so as manipulation. I would text him trying to help, offering advice, and so on, which was mentally draining because any time I'd try and help he'd continue texting things like ""I'm just gonna kill myself"". I have told him so many times he needs professional help and by doing so will improve his mental health. 

He's nearly 30 and has barely held a job because he ""hates all the managers"" wherever he works and continuously drops out of school to sit at home and be handed money by his mom and play PS4 all day. When I encourage finding a different job or so on he gets offended and tells me I'm a ""slave"" because I have a full time job.

I've since entered a new relationship with someone I love very much. When my ex randomly occasionally texts me (he texts me probably once every 10-15 days) saying he wants to kill himself I panic and reply and try to help. I told my current bf about helping my ex and he was understandably upset. I know I need to stop communication with my ex but I worry by telling him we need to stop talking he actually will kill himself. I have told a close friend this and they told me if he doesn't want to accept help or seek any help, and kills himself, at least I tried and there was nothing more I could do. 

The other day at work I checked my phone and had a ton of missed texts from him saying he was going to kill himself  &amp; that he has no reason to live anymore. All the texts made me panic terribly, I had to leave work because I started crying and ended up calling suicide prevention (they were beyond unhelpful) because I know he needs help. After 4 years of hearing him talk about being depressed, and never accepting help and then breaking up and still hearing it through text and STILL trying to get him to see a professional and get help I am honestly burned out and mentally drained. I don't know what else I can do at this point besides telling him, for the last time, he needs help and due to me being in a new relationship we need to stop talking and I wish him the best.",videostore01,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdn8t6/ex_bf_is_suicidal_depressed_and_mentally_not/

I've ruined my whole damn life before it's even started,"Pretty sure this will get buried in all the other posts but I guess I need somewhere to vent... either that or i just want to remind myself what a piece of shit i am. 

I've been depressed pretty much my entire life, i never realised it, i thought everyone was sad all the time and had a constant pit in their stomach like they wanted to cry and had random thoughts about killing themselves. 
I've been going through this shit since elementary school. 
I've always been the akward kid that was overly loud and made jokes at my own expense in order to get others to crack a smile. 
I've never been good at keeping friendships let alone making friendships. Ive always considered myself a loner in a way, mainly because I always feel like I want to be alone. 

I've never been to a party unless it was for a birthday, never gone drinking with friends, never really had a conversation with anyone without it turning into an akward silence after a while. 
I'm currently a senior in highschool and I feel like I've wasted my highschool years. 

My freshman year I met this girl, she was great, caring, shy, cute, and seemed to truly listen to what i said. 
I never had the balls to ask her out which I suppose was a good thing because later on I found out that she was gay. 

After half a year, she got more and more involved with the highschool lgbt community which was full of just flat out rude people. 
This changed her... for the worse. She started spending alot less time with me, and before I knew it we had gone an entire month without spending any time together. I'd always ask her if she wanted to hang out but she was always ""busy"". 

She slowly started to do a complete 180 from who she used to be. She was becoming very self centered and was always saying how nice of a person she is. 
I eventually stopped talking to her completely because I realised she was destroying me. I was in love with who she used to be and I guess I thought that the harder I tried to be her friend, maybe shed start to like being around me again, i guess i was wrong. 
At one point i stopped even acknowledging her like she did to me and i guess this annoyed her because she would text me and ask me why i was doing it. 
I'd send a lengthy text explaining why and it's like she didnt even read it because she kept doing the exact same things that i told her were making me feel like trash below her. 

This friendship absolutely destroyed me and i became extremely depressed. I became somewhat of a hermit that would go to school and as soon as I got home would sleep until the next day. 
I still am really sad about what happened and I cant help but blame myself for not doing something or saying something earlier about how her friends were making her treat others. 

Well, basically, this kind of destroyed me self esteem and any confidence I had left. I was now the quiet kid at school, although my friend says that i dont really seem like the quiet type, I'm 6 foot 2 inches tall and am built like a ""viking"" as he says. 
I havent spent time with him in months because I can barely bring myself to leave my house. 
He is pretty much my last friend and i feel like I'm letting him slip away like i have with all my other friends and its destroying me but I'm too afraid to do anything about it. I hate myself, I'm a terrible friend and I dont know how to change it. 

I've always been known as the ""nice guy"" who helps in any way I can and likes to talk to anyone who is willing to give me the time of day. Now.... well I dont even know. 
There was a lady at the store the other day who dropped something, she had a cane and her arms full and I just fucking watched her struggle to pick her stuff up off the ground. What kind of fucking person just watches someone struggle??? Apparently I do... I just like, froze I guess, I couldn't move my body, it was like I was paralyzed and I had a pit in my stomach and I felt just really anxious if that's how youd describe it. 
I hate who I've become, I just want to go back to being the kind guy who always helps others instead of watching them struggle like a jackass. 

I dont know how to fix who I have become and I'm afraid it's going to affect me when I try and get a job this summer and when I go to college, I'm afraid I'm going to be this shell of who i used to be, someone who just watches things happen instead of giving a helping hand. I feel like agoddamn failure, mainly because I am. 

I guess this story type thing doesnt really have any point, just me talking to myself reflecting on how much of an asshole I am. If someone actually reads this, well, then I'd love any suggestions on how i can get rid of this damn shell. 

I left alot of details out, but it's 1am and I have school in the morning so maybe I'll come back sometime on my computer and fill in a bit more.

Why can't I be happy for friends who are doing well for themselves,"Whenever I run into a friend I always try and be supportive and happy for them if they are doing well. I honestly am happy for them but when I stew over it for a while and just feel bad about my own situation.  I know everyone has there own challenges that I am not seeing, I just get to see the good side of their situation, but I can't help but feel shitty.    

I'm doing ok, but if I didn't have this fucking depression I know I'd be doing better. I can't make progress I've tried to force myself but that seems to just make things worse, I also don't have it that bad so I feel like I'm unrelatable.

Diary Entry 01 - I hate Xi Jin Ping,"Dear Diary,

I feel myself, yet again, sliding into the abyss of darkness.

Is it better that I remain fueled by anger and frustration at the CCP? When hopelessness overtakes anger, I feel sucked into a swirling vortex of desolation.

Knives, scissors, any shiny sharp object - they all beckon warmly, seducing me with sweet promises of an end to this pain.

Carefully laid plans, budgets, all gone awry because of a situation beyond control. Exacerbated by one man's greed for power and face.

I fear to run out of anger. When fury no longer triggers, and desolation lays waste to sanity, it would probably be the beginning of the end.

Another long frustrated rant,"So I've been seeing a therapist for a couple of months now, and besides all the other upsides of therapy, I think my favorite and also most frustrating part is that my therapist confirmed that I am incredibly self-aware. 

To the point that she usually just agrees with me and I spend a lot of my sessions just talking to myself. Because I already know why my thoughts are irrational. I know I shouldn't let these things bother me. I know I'm not alone. I know this is an ongoing thing, I know, I know I know. 

And that's so frustrating. Because knowing doesnt make me feel any better. Knowing I need to learn how to like myself better and be okay to be alone  doesnt help me actually get there. And when I get there, or think I've gotten there, I dont really feel any better. 

Yes, I'm lonely. I should learn to enjoy my own company and spend time with people who actually want to be with me. Great! Done that! Do this all the fucking time. But I feel the same. I'm still lonely. I still hate myself. 

Worst part is that I cant even blame anyone or anything. I did this. I'm doing this. I'm the problem. 

My therapist part of the problem is that I overthink and keep having these expectations for myself. That I should try to just ""do"" what feels right. But I already do that. If anything, I do it too much. That's why I'm starting to accumulate so much junk in my house.

I genuinely feel good after being depressed for over one year straight,"Hey! The past year I've been really depressed. I tried to kill myself and felt like it wasn't getting better at all. I somehow managed to deal with everyday life, but I didn't really live. I knew what kind of behavior was appropriate and I tried acting accordingly, but I didn't feel what I was doing. The destination of my thoughts was always suicide. I thought about it a lot. I planned multiple suicide attempts. I wrote  farewell letters. Stuff like that. 
Now I slowly return to my true self. It's like I'm able to see the world in colour again. It's not that I'm always happy. There are days I feel bad. Even days I'm depressed again. But it's way better than it used to be. I'm in touch with my feelings again. I've almost forgotten how sensitive I was. I feel alive again and that's fucking amazing!

Help me name a feeling,"First of all, some details about me. I am 25 years old male in my last semester of college (yaaay!) and I call myself protypal geek - introverted IT guy who loves fantasy and Sci-fi. I am from a small European country. 

I am struggling with a feeling I can't quite name. Most of the time I feel incomplete, like some vital piece of me is missing. This feeling goes away and the world turns brighter the minute I start feeling attracted to someone. Just the possibility of having a girlfriend makes me happy, that feeling of hope. And the minute I lose that hope.. well.. hello darkness my old friend.

I've read the usual advice ""you need to be complete by yourself, find a new hobby or something that makes you happy"". I've tried, really tried. It's possible to silence it, but not remove it. When I focus on work, or on a game, a book, anything I need to put my mind on, it goes away. Unless I have a really bad day, then I need to drill through it if I want to get something done.

It kinda sounds like depression triggered by loneliness, is something like that even possible? It also have pretty firm grasp on my life, on my actions to be precise. I am driven to look for at least that hope. I am currently trying to expand my social circle. I found out that there is a pretty big fantasy/LARP community in our country. Problem is that I am going in with finding a girlfriend as my main goal. Yeah I will probably have lots of fun, but that's secondary. Rationally it sounds pretty bonkers.

One last thing I should probably mention is that I had girlfriends in the past, but with big pauses between them. The shortest pause was half a year but a standard pause is around two years which is also for how long I am alone now. One of my theories is that all this is happening because I am operating in scarcity mindset.

Im struggling with depression and anxiety and ADHD symptoms, but the therapist that was supposed to refer me to a doctor to see about medicine hasnt done that yet.

Low,"My head feels crazy like super foggy and slowed down but also spinning at 100mph because im thinking about so much and stressed but also feel nothing and low and its very confusing so im trying to list 
Why am i feeling low starting from immediate problems to longer lasting /more distant problems:


-struggling to write essay

-4 separate deadlines looming, haven't even started reading for 3 of them

-everyone is better than me

-i do not feel like i deserve to be at the uni i am at because i do not feel clever enough or that i fit in and feel like no one cares about me

-my classmate/friend is 700x better than me at everything... She is genuinely good at everything and she loves to ""unknowingly"" rub it in my face and make dehumanising comments if i ever even allude to struggling with anything by the slightest amount... Like if i ever even start to ask her for help or talk about how i dont understand a lecture before i even get a sentence out she cuts me off with ""what? Noooooooo dont be so sILLY, thats obvious!"" or goes on about how easy she finds it or how ""i dont need to go to revision because i know everything and [talking about exam we did earlier in the term which she hasn't looked at her grades for yet] i would know if i got anything wrong and i know i didnt because i know what i was doing"" blah blah blah ok I get it u know everything and are god sent

-If i even suggest i might not be all that ok upstairs she tells me im fine and that i dont need to worry and literally just shuts me down and then  immediately complains when i dont talk to her when we walk to lectures together

-my friend is fucking the most self absorbed person you know and she doesnt even realise and to make it worse we are from polar opposite social classes (i.e she is rich, privately educated, lived extremely sheltered and ungrateful life where ahe gets whatever she wants whenever) so she always makes comments about things like if i mention student debt she LITERALLY went ""well your parents pay for university so dont worry""... And i had to go ""no they cannot afford to do that"" and then proceed to tell her, yes, i have had a job since i was 14 and no it wasnt because i wanted experience it was so i could afford the luxury of university and then explain what a bursary was and she kept making ignorant remarks like ""wha- why would you need that"" ""it doesn't cost thAT much"" and just... She is quite dehumanising and makes me feel like utter worthless shit. Its annoying because she doesnt realise how lucky she is and how lucky she is to of had to many opportunities handed to her and all the connections she has to good companies and high paying jobs just because of who her parents are... Like... All im saying is i wish she would stop being so blind to the world and actually learn that there are other people that exist that haven't lived the same life as her and i wish she would be respectful to people and not so fucking oblivious to the world!

-i miss home

-i am burnt out and need a break but i do not and will not ever get one because as soon as term is over, i need to revise. Then term starts and i learn. Then term ends and i revise and study and work and revise. No break ever.

-anxiety through the roof about everything

-i miss home

-other stuff like memories about things i forgot ever happened but i cant remember all the details or i remember everything over and over again and im not sure why they make me feel so horrible or nervous because theyre not necessarily bad events im just thinking about memories or events from when I was younger or not even from that long ago but i wish i wouldnt remember anything because it seems to be bothering me

-comparing myself to my sister, my sister being better than me, im expected to do really really well at uni ""for your sister"" (according to my mother since my sister is taking a year out of uni)... So MY degree isnt about me anymore its about doing it for my fucking sister who has basically stolen everything from me and now since she i taking a year out all the attention is on her, which is fine but now eveyone assumes she is the only one allowed to suffer and i am doing fantastic because i haven't dropped out or taken a year out or anything so apparently that means im fucking fantastic and going to get a 1st in my exams (""for"" my sister... Because i dont matter)... And i also cant go to my parents, not that i ever would have before, because all attention is on my sister and i am not allowed to let them down i have to do well for my sister

How do you wake up and brave the bullsh** of life when everywhere you look you see nothing but hate?

People killing each other left and right, hating each other for the color of their skin, for the way they dress, the people they love, and the higher powers they choose to believe in.

I’ve been so low the past couple weeks I haven’t felt like myself at all. I’ve felt a fair amount of that apathy I read about on this sub often, and it’s scary.

I know the things I need to do in order to overcome this depression - the tools I can reach for. Exercise, nutrition, therapy, group therapy, being open with friends and family, volunteering, strong social connections, medical health, and on and on. The laundry list is long and tough to grapple with all at once. But having a couple of weeks of pure hell makes me realize that I’m really not working on any one of those things strongly. 

What have I done to really move forward in the last year? I feel like I haven’t really reached for any of those huge steps since I started therapy in 2015. I’ve been going for over four years, and it’s been life-changing, but what other healthy steps have I taken? 

Last summer my dental health became overwhelming, something I must take care of. I went back for my first appointment in years. Gradually I took care of my pain and the rot in my mouth was alleviated. I lost a tooth in the process but a huge weight was lifted as well. 

I need some similar weight lifted now, but most of all I want to be able to reach for it. I crave some discipline; the dental work came as a result of time running out as it were, reactive not proactive. I want to be strong enough to work thru this shit at a healthy pace, not leave things go awry for months on end, until a consequence happens. But I suppose in order to get there I have to first admit that I AM weak and I DO need help. I can’t do it all on my own like I tell myself I must. 

I’d really like to get an exercise bike. I can see all the positives: cardio health/body positivity/motivation to hike more/overall getting in shape. For someone healthy, buying a bike (putting in the research, going to stores, asking people for advice) would be doable. Simple tasks like that are fucking hard for me because I’m not healthy.

So how do I get there? Ask my sister to take me shopping one day? This post is a good start: question why I’ve failed in the past and talk through the doable steps, remind myself of the positive outcomes in working thru it. Maybe I need to meditate again: breathe thru the pressure in my chest when I think about going to a bike store or talking to people on Craigslist. 

I wish I could work thru these things easily like a normal person. I guess my win today is admitting I’m broken and depression is at fault. Maybe if I admit that more often I’ll see it’s ok to ask for help and beat myself up less.

I’ve never really lost love for myself because I know I’m a good man. My therapist told me that purpose can be looked at as two halves: BEing and DOing. Right now I’m happy with my self-philosophy and who I am when I’m NOT depressed. That person is good. It’s time to accept that I’m not healthy enough to DO good yet. At least not to the degree that I hope my future holds. It’s hard to reconcile how much depression is holding me back. I hope I can look myself in the mirror this deeply in the next little while and reach for more of that help that I need to pick myself up off the ground. Maybe it can start with the exercise bike.",OutsideitCZ,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdk76f/i_still_struggle_admitting_i_need_help/

"This is all too much for me today, I want to disappear for a while","I've struggled with major depressive disorder for years now, I was officially diagnosed in 2016 but I know I had it for about 5 years before that at least. I've had a suicide attempt (right before officially being diagnosed) and since have had ups and downs... the downs happen about every other year.

Tonight I'm sitting at work, wanting to run away, cry, and hide. I've been doing fairly good lately but I just received life changing news a few nights ago, and I am not ready for this change.

I told my SO exactly how I feel and what I want (well maybe I should say don't want), which was relieving and helped me feel better for a few minutes but now I'm back to stressed out and wanting to cry. I'm worried he secretly hates that I don't want the change. Will he break up with me even though we are engaged and haven't had any issues? I hope not.. he always tells me he wants me to be honest with him and not keep things from him, so I'm trying to be open/honest but I know he doesn't enjoy hearing my honest opinions and feelings at times.

How can you bring a child into the world though when both parents would be in debt, one is jobless, we aren't even married yet, I struggle with my mental health/anxiety regarding everything about having a kid even all the crap before they are born, and one parent is a registered sex offender still on probation???

I can't do this. I was hopeful for the first couple of days... but then i started considering more about our situation and how we are NOT ready. I haven't tols many people at all, but I told him today if I can't abort it then I want to seriously give it up for adoption. I just can't. 

Call me irresponsible for not being more careful. I try to have the mentality of ""everything happens for a reason"" but I can feel myself falling apart mentally. Work helps distract me to a degree but there is a lot of downtime tonight and I keep ruminating and feeling down. I'm also pretty sure I'm too far along to get an abortion and it isn't like we can afford it anyway. FML :( :( :(

Can't seem to catch a break,"Just as my month long problem was slowly coming to an end and thing's were looking somewhat up for me more stress and worry has been thrown at me.   


After a month of stressing over getting back into my main group of friends who decided some separation would benefit everyone I learn that I was likely not going to be welcomed back...least not by the few members who genuinely didn't like me. My closest friend had a heart to heart with me about it and even though it still hurts losing the only place I felt I could relax and enjoy myself I was starting to let it go now that I knew I didn't have to worry about coming back. Still have some hangups about it all but again it was all getting better.  


Then I dont here from my Girlfriend for 3 days, finally getting a message from her the day after my birthday with her saying she's dealing with stuff and that none of its my fault and that I didnt do anything. She wont talk to me about it whatever it is and I know its bad cause she isn't acting like herself. Part of me is afraid it has to do with me but isn't my fault. I talked with a close friend and I was able to regain some of my reasoning to eventually tell her that until she wants to talk with me I'll leave her be and give her space to think. But it's still a bit disheartening that she doesn't say I love you back...its been 2 insistence and the second time she just said ""You Too"" so maybe she's just distracted by her thoughts and forgot.   


This year has been the saddest year of all for me, I wont say depressing cause I haven't been diagnosed, and I'm just hoping these feelings go away cause I'm not myself and that annoys me to no end. I'm the guy who helps others, talks them through their issues, makes people laugh, makes others happy. I'm not the sad, whimpering, insecure, paranoid guy I'm acting like...

An ode to grief,"I just made a journal entry and I thought I could share it to see if it helps anyone going through grief stages. 

There’s something that happens to a person when a piece of your soul passes away. You realize that you’re in denial all this time. That something you never thought you would want becomes something you realized you pushed away into the ignorant side of your mind so you wouldn’t think about it. So yes, a part of my soul is gone. And I’ve been trying to numb that pain that is beyond any kind of description. I feel like I had something precious that was ripped out of my hands and lit on fire to burn. Something that was alive and part of me burned and I could feel that slow, painful burn. Like watching someone you love get tortured by some unknown entity. This results in the stages of grief.... there’s denial. Which I already had since I was a child. I grew up in ignorant bliss. Not wanting to acknowledge what I knew was true. 
The there was anger. This nasty creature that you create to get back at whatever hurt you. And it will literally drive you mad. Crazy, trying to show others how much someone hurt you. Trying to find something called “closure” ( which by the way is the only fairytale or myth that you will ever hear. Closure is the only thing in the world that is impossible). Now you’re stuck in this miserable monster. You wonder how you’ll escape alive and some never do. I’m sorry for the ones who were the center of my anger and unclearity. You did not deserve what I gave you from my period of grief.
Then you bargain. For the sake of whatever sanity you may have left. You bargain for hope, freedom, and whatever else that you have. It’s not a lot. But regardless you bargain just the same. You try to find people who will help and love you unconditionally. Then you realize that they can’t enable the grief anymore than you can. You’re left alone again. Wondering who the hell you have become because it just isn’t you anymore. You’ve become this sad and hopeless mess of a person. The people you love love you so much they can’t take your struggling any more that you can. That’s when your soul dies a little more.
Then there is depression. That’s there through y’all of the stages. That feeling of NO motivation. No life. It’s an empty void but filled with all the feeling mentioned prior. Depression makes you remember your not the only one. You are made of many sad and hurting people who just want some sort of clarity. They just question every day “ why? What can I do? Why am I feeling these things.” This makes you wonder if your feelings are even ok to feel. 
Supposedly, there is acceptance.... I have not gotten there yet. Most with depression haven’t. Good luck to all of us. This is that bridge that we have not crossed and some (myself) are very afraid to cross it. It means that we will be ok. And sometimes that’s really scary because we don’t always know how to feel ok anymore. We have the beautiful loved ones that have been there no matter what. They want our success and happiness. A deep part of our soul wants that too.... the part that is still alive. We forget that part don’t we? My beautiful friends. There is a soul in our bodies. One that has not been ripped away. One that cannot be taken from an ugly thing such as grief. Every day that we are here. Together. Let’s reach out to the part of our soul that has survived. And let us remember that we are more than our grief and suffering.

First session with new counsellor and it was... weird,"Ok so while this is definitely not my first time going to counseling, this was the first meeting with a new counsellor. It was set up through my work's EAP service, which I've used before with limited success. 

Anyway, I had my first session this week and it was weird. First of all, it was in a very unconventional location. It was in an office (I mean literally a room with a desk and some office chairs), inside an organization not typically known for mental health services. So that was weird and it took me a while to get comfortable enough to start talking. 

Since this was the first session, most of it was just me explaining what was going on in my life and why I'm there. Anyway, near the end she remarked that I was a fascinating person and she really wants to talk to me more. That's my first time hearing that, especially from a professional. Then she asked me if I was familiar with the mbti, to which I replied I am not a fan. She also suggested I check out metaphysics because it might help me or something. 

I Dunno , I walked out of there feeling strange. On one hand, the counselor was nice and all, but on the other hand, certain things made me a bit uncomfortable.

how do you regain self-worth,"throwaway:)

As the title says, I am a very insecure person. I have grown up with parents who gave little affection to me and a narcissistic father who has crushed any self worth I have. Throughout middle and high school, I was popular but at the same time, I was never anyone's favorite person. I thought it was because I never had freedom or a phone during those times. I managed to escape and go to school away from my parents in college, but if anything, I have become even worse. I am so desperately afraid of losing the friends that I have made, in particular, someone who is the FIRST person in my life to have feelings for me. He knows me like the back of my hand, but now that we are doing long distance, it's naturally just harder and sometimes I come off as insecure when I ask him things. Most of the time, he is the only one I talk to about many things such as my parents which many don't understand. I just really don't want to lose him and he has said that he is tired of me being insecure, but I am naturally just not that special or pretty or smart and I can't help it. I wasn't like this when I met him, but I can't stop thinking about how he's going to find someone infinitely better when he starts his new job soon and never look at me again.

I am in college so I have little time for hobbies but I still read and work out in my free time. Most of the time I am studying, but I barely get by in school and can't land an internship for the summer.

Resigned from my paid internship today. I'm worried about the immediate future.,"I felt too overwhelmed balancing graduate-level schoolwork and a paid internship, and I felt like I wasn't getting as much done as I would have liked, wasting a lot of time. So I asked my advisor via email if I could end my contract early, for the research position I was given. 

He accepted the resignation, but I've been nervous bringing it up for weeks now. I was worried because I've been coming in late or on some days not at all. My depression is getting worse, and I feel like my antidepressant dosage is too low to be effective. I'm not sure which is a bigger black mark on my resume/needing a future recommendation for a job: not showing up to work because I'm having a depressive episode, or ending the internship to spare them from further episodes. 

It's the first time I've been employed as a STEM major, and I've completely messed it up. I only have rent money left and then, who knows. I feel so shitty and small, and mostly stupid. I can't possibly say that I've changed my mind now, it'll look too odd after all the rigamarole I went through trying to quit, emailing various advisors and internship coordinators. 

I'm so tired, and my boyfriend thinks that I've shot myself in the foot and yelled in disbelief. ""I don't know how to make it better,"" he said.

I don't want to work hard,"I just don't. I feel so empty whenever I think about quitting playing videogames and smoking weed. I feel so, so burdened by having to learn things and develop skills. This is why I can't go back to school, because to be successful in school I'd have to start practicing a lot of new skills. I hate practicing skills. I hate practicing writing. I hate reading just for the sake of reading and self improvement. 

I don't care if I technically get better at stuff. It doesn't make me feel any better and it's actually a cause of suffering for me. Learning new things and going out of my way to practice skills is so un-enticing to me, that I legitimately believe my life has no hope and I'd rather be dead. There is no reward. No reward can give me back the time I lose to working diligently at something. And everything is so fucking boring. Knowing that I have to suck it up and literally CHOOSE to like things like hard work just make me want to go on a killing spree. It feels like a grave injustice. It's too late for me.

I no longer reap ANY pleasure from hard work, from building connections, from sitting and reading, from studying; all this shit does is make me agitated and bored, but also hopeless, because there is no hope for me.

Same shit as everything else in this sub,"I have been having more and more chest pains while I have a heart condition. I’ve been to the ER for it before but at this point as much as I want to live I don’t think I’ll ever be happy living. The more I’ve been thinking more about the world and people the more I realize how little control we have. We are attracted to people because that’s who our environment and biology tells us to be attracted to, we do actions based on the same two things. As you can probably tell I’m a hard determinist. I don’t believe anyone is special, I don’t believe in love. Most days I have slivers of happiness but those slivers are over come with feelings of extreme loneliness. When I say slivers I mean a second or two followed by a dive into the abyss of sadness. Anyone I think I actually connect to leaves. I don’t blame them either. I’m talking to this women who tells me that kissing for her is not cheating. I tried to understand why I would feel bad if someone I was with kisses someone else, is it my insecurity, is it my fear they will leave (under the umbrella of insecurity, I realize) idk. She tells me each connection you have is special but I’m thinking if they’re all special, then, none of them are. And if this connection was so special why would the person sever it. I mean there might be a multitude of reasons but at the end of the day it becomes as if that “special” person doesn’t exist anymore. But, if y’all do manage to keep talking how does one person not feel the pain. I guess you both have to be in healthy relationships on your own (that could end at any moment) and have to not depend on a relationship. Isn’t our end goal to produce viable offspring though. So wouldn’t we be working, looking good, exercising all to make us an appealing mate. Is there any authenticity if you have no control over the people you bond with and they don’t either. Is their anyone special out there to face the cruel oblivion with or are we, more so am I, destined to feel alone for the rest of my life. Ugh I hate this, I feel like shit and lonely but logic my way out of it but still feel like fucking garbage :( if we meet someone special shouldn’t that be enough to make us happy, since some people never feel that.

Life is tough,"I don't know if this belongs here and I apologize if it doesn't. This post is meant to be rhetorical. No additional details will be provided and no feedback is required. Just getting some thoughts out of my head in hopes my brain can find a little peace.

Recently I've been dealing with a lot of negativity. I'm in jeopardy of losing my family due to some actions I've taken/decisions I've made. My girlfriend and her two little boys have given my life purpose. Before they became my life I would spend more nights at the bar than not, simply because it was something to do. I didn't do this to pick up chicks or anything, it just was better than sitting at home. If I lose them I don't really know what I would do with my life.

There's a quote from Ernest Hemingway that goes ""Every man has two deaths, when he is buried in the ground and the last time someone says his name.""  I am by no means contemplating suicide or being buried. It got me thinking about completely severing ties with everyone I've ever known and starting life over somewhere else though. Essentially burying the life I've had so far.

How long would it take before my friends and family stop trying to find me? How long before I'm not a daily/weekly/monthly thought on their mind? How long before I'm a distant memory or not a memory at all. Could I even do it? I already go weeks without talking to my parents. Longer without talking to my family. Random amounts of time without talking to friends. There's few people I talk to daily and the only person I can say I talk to daily with 100% certainty is my girlfriend. 

I wonder if I could truly run away from it all and start a new life if the life I have now falls apart. Could I manage to find a new purpose that wouldn't be caught in the shadow of the purpose I feel now?",anon8372627383,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fdpmwh/life_is_tough/

I wish i could somehow be better and go back to being happy, but I know I’m fucked beyond repair. I have no hope in anything and I’m scared of the future because I don’t see myself in it.

Dating While Depressed?,"So to put the question into context so everyone can understand where I'm coming from. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for years, really fucked up childhood but some better took me in when I was a preteen so that helped but I still feel everything. Now I've been to therapy a couple times and they helped but that was when my insurance covered it now it doesn't so I don't have a therapist. I'm debating on getting onto some meds and seeing a psychiatrist. Anyways point is can I date if I'm making steps to get better? I'm a 21 ginger virgin male with lots of insecurities and depression doesn't help. In fact I'm worried I have bi polar disorder because my symptoms fall into that category more so than MDD. My point is I constantly feel like any woman can and should do better than me. I have this crippling feeling every time I like a girl I think ""just stop, they can do better leave her alone"" literally ALL my friends are in relationships and I want it so bad. I want what they have but I have little to no experience, the one ego boost I have is I was once told I was the best kisser she's ever met and she been around the block a couple times. I'll be honest I miss her to, she was someone I would've been willing to lose the V to and risk the rejection because she was so nice and one of the most non judgmental people I've ever met and she was a nerd to lol. She moved States for school so our fun was cut short.  Should I try to date? It's really hard for me since I've never been in love and don't know what to look for. I also wanna get the virgin thing outta the way so I'm not one when I'm 40. Fuck society and it's social stigmas, they're impossible not to follow it seems. I just don't see how I can date if I'll have these feelings for a few more years and I don't want to be 30 year old man with no experience either.

"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail.

*******

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",SQLwitch,253,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cz6nfd/new_wiki_on_how_to_avoid_accidentally_encouraging/
Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is allowed here. Not today or any day.,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide *is*, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times.  

Please understand that we're all for well-informed, strategically-savvy activism.  It's essential in the fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and the fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding.  Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL.  

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population.  We used to allow it, until the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming, and, not without regret, we made this rule.  Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our members' wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**Please report any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's mainly about a cause or an issue rather than a request for personal support.**",SQLwitch,116,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/iq0w21/please_remember_that_no_activism_of_any_kind_is/
Today is 4 years since I shot myself,"4 years ago in the midst of psychotic breakdown I sat in my driveway at 7am July 31st 2017 with gun to my temple, cocked and loaded. I put it towards my thigh at the last moment pulled the trigger and a 9mm defense round went through my thigh. I spent 2 weeks in emergency then 3 weeks in psych. 4 years later I'm still here. Got a nice scar on my right thigh. My mental health has been suffering bad this year dealing with an injury for 6 months from broken bones in ankle and a completely shredded ligament.  I get surgery on it in a couple weeks. I went to bed last night telling myself if I woke up sad I'd finish what I started 4 yrs ago. But I'm still here. My cat is curled up next to my injured ankle and I'm trying to be strong. Trauma memories get the best of me this time of year from a lifetime of abuse but I'm thankful for the positive people I do have in my life. I'm thankful for my cat. I'm still here. For today. I'm here.


Edited for misspelling *
Edited again to add this = I shot my thigh because I had to feel something but something made me not shoot my temple so the thigh made sense to me at the time. Like I had to use the weapon on myself that I needed to feel it. It's too much to type to try to explain it. Therapist is helping me try to make sense of it.

Everything was like a dream before last night,"I was happy for 3 months straight. I had given up my all bad habits, stopped self harm and drinking it was all because of her. It was all because i loved her and never wanted to make her feel sad over me. She was my only reason to live, my only reason to try to hold on to this life. Yesterday my friend messaged me about how changed i am and i am behaving like toy to this girl. He never knew what I was going through. He wrote some bad things I did before I meet her on his messages some of them were exaggeration and lies.

How Can I Go To Hell When I'm Already There?,"My life is shit. My friends are tired of me and my problems from my shitty life, whenever I try to connect with someone on a romantic level it always goes nowhere or I end up being heartbroken, and none of my hobbies or interests bring me joy anymore. I'm pushing 30 and people keep telling me I'm still so young, but I have enough underlying health issues it's guaranteed my lifespan is way past halfway over. I have nothing going for me except the end.  


Tonight I told my mother how I really felt and instead of being concerned or even showing an ounce of care, she looked me right in the eyes and told me ""Suicide is the worst sin you can commit and you'll go straight to hell."" My own mother, the very person who brought me into this world and used to be so happy she finally had me after so many miscarriages, can't even show she cares in my darkest moment. When I walked away she was still blabbing on about how I'll be in hell for all eternity like she's chastising me for even having the thought.

Hey look it’s another post of a depressed person venting about how messed up their family is,"If you dealt with abuse or shit I advise not reading because that’s the whole fucking post.

First post here, been reading posts here for a while now. First of all, I think that no one deserves to feel like absolute shit. (I’m typing this up while I have my daily 5 minutes of happiness and 5 minutes of actually being able to think about things properly) I’m only 13, my parents are not so nice I’ll just say that. They used to beat me, but now they just yell and blame shit on me. I feel like they’re taking advantage of my 3 year old brother, because he can’t call the police or do shit about it.

My parents often beat my brother, it’s kinda sad, and I’m not helping because I have anger issues (according to a “friend” at school I’m the rage monster or some shit) when my brother gets mad and stuff, I sometimes just can’t help myself and just yell at him. It’s a shit move, but at the time it seemed very reasonable, until 5 minutes later when I regret life decisions and convince myself that I’m a terrible human being. I just love having mood swings all the fucking time.

My very good parents also lock my brother in a room, make him stand against a wall and take a photo of it and post it to family and relatives, making a joke about it, but then my brother is being traumatized and fucking crying. 

I really don’t know where I’m going with this post I guess i just kinda want to vent to people. Because I have no friends irl that even care about my existence. If anyone wants to talk that would be really nice. I haven’t talked to many people at all lately, it seems like everyone else is having a better life than me.",kermit_alivent,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovmmqr/hey_look_its_another_post_of_a_depressed_person/

I (27F) keep finding my thoughts coming back to suicide,"A little context: I'm a 27 year old trans woman who's been in university for 8 years, my only break was a year after my first graduation where I tried (and failed desperately) to get a job in my field. I've known I was trans since I was 19, though had a feeling about it since I was 5, but still waited til this year to do anything cos I'm an indecisive fuck. I've attempted suicide twice, though only once was premeditated. I'm autistic so I don't know if I'll ever get work. I hate myself so much that I will exclaim it in a completely empty room, apropos of nothing.  


For the past 5 months, I've thought about suicide more and more. It's not an active choice, more like I'll be going about my business and feel the compulsive urge to jump in front of a train or out my second story window. When I walk across the street my brain screams ""hit me"" when I see a car. I frequently wonder what's stopping me from just downing all my medication at once. These thoughts used to be once a day, but now dominate my thinking so much I can't study or do these measly amount of writing I need to make cash. It's also getting harder to morally justify existing. I think about how much it takes for me to stay alive vs the deadendedness of my existence and feel unbelievably selfish.

PROOF that I should commit suicide.,"**I took ten paracetamol tablets last night.** 

Soon after, realising how bad it was, I drove myself straight to the hospital. 

The people at the hospital were really nice about it. They highlighted how reckless it was, but they offered their support, and said that I did the right thing by seeking help.

**My family, on the other hand, were less helpful. I told them I collapsed at work. I didn't say I self-harmed.**

They sent me constant messages asking me what was taking so long to get my blood test results back.

&gt;If it takes this long, it's clearly not serious.

In the end, it wasn't serious. I had some signs of an overdose, but not the liver damage they thought they would see.

My sister came to pick me up, and she said:

&gt;I can't believe you went to the emergency room for fainting! Fainting is not an emergency.  
&gt;  
&gt;You just wasted my petrol money.

If that was all that happened, it would have just been a nuisance. However, my Dad yelled at me and full-on started swinging at me.

&gt;WHY DID YOU GO TO HOSPITAL?

He was worried about the COVID-19 risk. I'm about to die, and he's worried about isolating for fourteen days.

I'll never do it.,"I've been here before in times of desperation. I've had many opportunities to end my life. I've tried a couple times, but always with pills, because they had a way to back out of it. 

I realized, I cannot do it. And the real kicker? It's because a part of me wants that dream girl.

The one who will ask like, every 10 minutes if you're okay just because she really cares about your mental health. The one who wants to talk about stupid shit and indulge my dumb rants. The kind of girl that wants to get high and just put on some $uicideboy$ and say fuck the world around us.

She's out there, and as long as she is, I cannot leave. 

Why the fuck do we feel this way? We do why hold onto hope? Is it better to pretend like something good COULD happen, rather than admit our mental state is what keeps us from truly experiencing the good?

Sometimes I wish assisted suicide was legal. To know, that I could just sleep like usual, and have somebody kill me while unaware, would be bliss. I'm not sad. I'm not miserable. I'm just alone, and it hurts a lot more than anything could. 

Sorry for the rant. I hope everybody finds their way. Nobody deserves the feeling of wanting to die.

To live or not to live and if to live for what purpose?,"Either way I look at life and how it should be lived, it just seems completely and utterly pointless with each choice we make regardless of what that choice may be leading to the same exact end result. Death with no guarantee of anything after. Acknowledging this helps us understand that life is what you make it and it is up to you to forge your purpose in life but what's the point of you're near indifferent to it all regardless of what you do to overcome the sense of apathy?

• The idea of relationships and having kids: Indifferent.
• Everything you once loved and had once brought you comfort: Indifferent.
• Your ambitions: You feel a calling but ultimately indifferent and emotionless to the fact.

How do we fight this indifference? This lack of love, lack of fear, lack of care despite the efforts we put into feeling otherwise? I feel much much better than I did a couple years ago but I'm exhausted and to the point where suicide is more of a choice made from a rational stand point than it is from an emotional one (driving factor for many who  make the choice).",Smart-Chart6337,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovkre0/to_live_or_not_to_live_and_if_to_live_for_what/

She told me I was special, she made plans for the future, she was alright to me.

I ruined it by ending the relationship because I felt like she didn’t put in effort. Well she really didn’t, she made promises to do things she never followed through with and even after discussing it she still never did.

I hate her. But I want her to love me.

There is no chance I will win her back because I am an annoying person.

I have been given 12 weeks to live. 

I don't want to spend my final days, pissing and shitting myself but trying to find the information to end my life with some degree of dignity is proving rather difficult. 

Even on Reddit I am unable to ask the questions I would like to as they are deemed unacceptable. 

It's strange, I don't feel depressed in regards to my suicidal thoughts which somehow makes my questions difficult. 

Is it more socially unacceptable for me to end my life via the use of an inert gas than to spend the next 3 months in a state where I might as well already be dead. Having my family around me with the look that they know I'm not going to make it but wearing a painted smile and pretending everything is normal.

Sadly, if I cannot find the necessary information then I may have to resort to less safe methods whereas I would prefer to go peacefully.

I've always had everything I needed to be happy. My family and I are super close. We've always travelled in and out of the country, have dinners in all the best places, play and have fun. My siblings and I treat each others like best friends. It's the kind of family you wish you had. I have genuine friends and a bunch of closest friends whom we treat each others as brothers and sisters. I grew up being loved by my peers because I've always been seen as bubbly, kind, and approachable. I'm famous in real life as well as in my social media. I have a bunch of people wanting to date me and I get who I want really. I get genuine compliments. I eat healthy, sleep healthy, and even go to the gym and read books. I make my own money and never really worry about it. I've experienced life the way it was meant to be experienced. I did some things that you could only see in movies or read in books. I could even confidently say I'm an interesting person. As I said, I've got everything I needed to be happy. But I'm not. If I were honest, I'm not even sad. There's just this overwhelming feeling of numbness that I couldn't explain. Like a hole. A looming shadow I somehow can't get rid of.
 
I've had depression since 6 years ago. Been diagnosed for 3 years. I never really talked about it, in fact, this is the first time I think I'll be able to say things to a bunch of people.

"Just need advice, or someone to listen."," 

Just looking for advice or maybe someone to talk to. just honestly not sure what to do. This is gonna be a very loaded post and contains some uncomfortable content (you have been warned). Also I want to apologize in advance for any spelling or grammatical errors, as I have had quite a bit to drink while writing this.

you'll need a little back story first so here it is,

I'm male 28 years old now but this takes place over the course of my childhood. When I was an infant I had rolled down a flight of stairs in a walker shattered my arm and cracked open my skull. The injury to my skull was so bad it had to have surgery. The surgeons had to remove a small portion of my skull to release the pressure on my brain. I made a full recovery and proceeded to live my childhood out happily with no problems. or at least that's what I would like to say... The surgery did not go over well. in fact it couldn't have gone any worse. thankfully I made it out alive. however the portion of skull they removed never fully grew back due to the complications during the surgery. Due to this I was (and still am) not allowed to play sports or work any slightly dangerous jobs or the like. basically if its nothing short of a desk job/sitting down I'm not allowed to do it. (Please Note I only have doctors records to go off of so I apologize if any information is missing, obviously I was infant and didn't remember any of this and wasn't told) Please also note that this injury left me with a learning disability. Its not that I'm stupid or cant learn I just don't retain what I learn very well and sometimes not at all.

Naturally because I wasn't allowed to do most things children would do, I had no friends, The target of some of the worst bullying imaginable and to make it worse this also continued at home. At home it was the worst. My own mother was even a part of it. Saying things like ""your an idiot"", ""do you even try to use your brain"", ""why did I end up with a disabled son"", ""maybe you should have died during that surgery"". and so much more. this was a daily occurrence. My brothers, sisters, and even step parents (yes more than one as my mother was a habitual cheater and couldn't hold a relationship longer than a month or two). I was and still am miserable every day. I thought I could suffer thru all the mental abuse but everything changed when I turned 13. That year my mother decided since I was no longer a child that she could hit me. I was beaten everyday. by my mother, step father(s) ( I had about 10 throughout my childhood), my own siblings, and of course bullies at school. Now when I say beat I'm not talking about paddled over the ass with a wooden spoon or light punching/slapping. I'm talking my step father once beat me with a two by four (piece of wood for those who don't know what that is) till he cracked three of my ribs, Bruises the size of softballs, bloody noses, black eyes, getting hit with whatever was in grabbing distance till it broke, cruel and unusual punishment's, locking me in a room for over 24 hours by myself, screaming at me till they were red in the face calling me all kinds of unimaginable things, and that's only the tip of the iceberg. They even turned my other siblings on me. But the worst of all that happened, I was ""passionately hugged"" at the age of 13 by my step father at the time. my mother watched from the doorway and didnt do or say anything. I was being held down by someone three times my size and all my mother did was watch. she fucking watched as I screamed for help. FUCKING. WATCHED.

Something died in me that day and was never the same again. I completely shut down. no one was gonna help me. even if I told someone I thought there's no on way they would believe me. At this time In my life ages 13-17. I would go on and try to commit suicide a total of 4 times nearly succeeding on my 4th attempt. I talked to no one, closed myself away from everyone, tried to be away from home as much as possible anything and everything not to be there anymore. Stayed with my aunt whenever I could (which wasn't often as she traveled for work). I Finally moved out at the age of 18. Literally walked out the door at 12:01am with my mother screaming at me the whole way out about how im a god awful child and a waste of space and wishing me to fail at everything in life before I was able to drive away.

Please note I'm omitting a LOT of details that are just so hard to bring up right now. But I will answer any questions or clear any confusion up just ask.

Fast forward to today and why I'm writing this post. I have never gotten over any of this, haven't forgiven a single one of them and probably wont ever be able to. I just want to know do I need help? should I see someone to talk about this? should I go to a therapist? This is the first time in 15 years I have ever spoken about any of this, although I think about it every day, so this is the first time I have told this to anyone (even if its just online). I cant sleep/eat properly, my mind races a million miles an hour all the time with all kinds of unwanted thoughts, short/long term memory loss, wild mood swings, the complete inability to trust a single soul have a relationship or even date for that matter, lost all sense of taste/smell, none of the things I used to do for fun are enjoyable anymore, its like the world has gone grey and stale. its been this way for over a decade now and I'm breaking finally. I just cant take it anymore. I just don't know what to do. more and more everyday I just want my suffering to end. But I'm to scared to talk with people or go out in public. I just cant trust. I haven't gone out in society at any level since I was a 18 and I'm 28 now. all groceries are delivered to my front door, bills all paid online, my job I work completely alone and at night so I don't have to deal with customers. I have completely made my life with as little human contact as possible. I thought this would help but if anything this has only made things worse. The only thing that seems to have changed from moving out is I now have a non-consensual relationship with nicotine and liquor. I feel like I'm going crazy. any thoughts or suggestions? any help tips would be appreciated. I really don't know how to handle this as I wasn't taught anything useful as a child... and im sure people are gonna say it. But i wish this story was a joke. I wish with every fiber of my being it was all a lie. but its not. so please don't be unnecessarily cruel. I'm really hurting right now, and it took a lot out of me just to write this.",Crimsoncrusader21,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovprkn/just_need_advice_or_someone_to_listen/

Always There,"Every two weeks I have a therapy appointment.

It took awhile to get to that point. The medical system isn't built for people who have trouble with keeping a schedule and managing stress.

Anyway, now I have a scheduled appointment on the books every two weeks.

It helps to talk to someone. I told her about this page and she advised me not to spend too much energy helping others because it can put unnecessary strain on myself to stay mentally balanced and people tend to take on the weight of the issues they are helping with.  Long story short, I haven't been on here a lot.

But there is something that bothers me about where I'm at. Every session at some point in the session the conversation stops and she turns to her computer then back at me and asks ""So how have the thoughts of suicide been.""

I cry.

It's hard that I have some example to tell her every time she asks. ""Oh well a couple days ago I thought about being dead but it wasn't that bad."" ""Last weekend I thought about how I would end it; but I know that I wouldn't actually do it.""

I feel like I'm reassuring her more than myself.

Yes I'm fine. No I won't kill myself. You've done your job. I'm safe.

She is a good therapist. I'm glad that she brings up things I don't always want to talk about. I'm just tired of having the thoughts.

I heard a song that made me think of my ex and I happened to be holding a pocket knife I just got today as a gift. I imagined what I could do with it.

Pain and blood and death.

So Tuesday I'll have another example to tell her about how I thought about killing myself.

trauma,"moving back with my parents is the worst decision i have ever made. i always felt i had a good childhood since i didn't remember much of it, but my seeing my father have an explosive episode of anger today suddenly gave me vivid flashbacks to when he used to beat me as a child, and numerous other traumatic instances. i have inherented severe mental illness from both of my parents who refuse to acknowledge they have a problem. my parents are both horrible people and i am desperately doing everything i can to not end up like them. I'm moving out in a couple months, but i genuinely don't know if i can make it until then. I have attempted suicide before when i was a teenager because of the way they treated me, and i just don't know how to deal with this trauma. a few years ago i even overheard them saying that they would rather have a dead child than a gay child. (i am gay, and i will never tell them) i know i will feel better when i move out but i don't know if i can ever overcome this trauma. i have no friends or place in society due to the way i was raised to behave.

It. Never. Stops.,"I cannot explain the feeling that comes up when thinking about this. I've been depressed for years and I constantly was about to give up; to kill myself. But then I gave life yet another chance. I went to a mental hospital. I said to myself again ""this is gonna be the LAST chance"". And the place traumatised me instead of helping. I got severly depressed after that. I used to have moments I felt like I became something else. Because of the hospital, that something else became a total other person. Still figuring out what this is actually.
I was about to kill myself when I talked a bit to my friends and they invited me to stay over. Since then I came over very often. They asked me to come every time :) &lt;3 
Yesterday the 2 friends who are a couple, were fighting again and they broke up. Long story short: one of them had to go with ambulance to hospital. I joined and ptsd for ambulances and sirens got triggered badly. After hrs I got back to the other friend and have had crying periods and moments I'm totally numb ever since.
The thing is: the friend group is demolished and the only thing that convinced me to not die was because they constantly distracted me from the constant suicidal thoughts.
Atm I just want to go to a tower I found in a forest, lusten to music, dissociate and then probably slit my wrist I guess?
I got a dormlife ahead of me. I should be happy. I just gave too many chances to life and my intrusice thoughts now say ""i will not give a chance anymore. I refuse to continue life, eve, if I'd win the lottery""

I’m not sure what to do,"I’ll try to keep this as short as I can. Ever since I was 5 years old I’ve wanted to kill myself. Ever since then my life has been one disaster after another. Recently my girlfriend cheated on me twice. We both still love each other but obviously things have changed. I no longer ever feel like I can trust her and she is not interested in me sexually at all. We both have mental issues and when I talk to her about this she gets really stressed, and so do I. 
I don’t want to break up with my girlfriend, I want to make it work somehow. But lately I’ve just been feeling like I want to die because of all of the unfortunate circumstances in my life. I’ve also been struggling with religion and it just feels like everything that could go wrong right now, is. If I don’t figure things out soon it might be too late. 
I honestly hate asking people for help but I don’t really know what else to do. I feel hopeless and miserable. I wish things with my girlfriend could go back to the same way they were before the cheating. And I just don’t know what to do with all these feelings of anger and extreme sadness.

Advice on seeking inpatient treatment,"hello, so I’m currently struggling with a serious depressive episode right now. fair warning this will probably be all over the place- my mind is a mess right now. so I was diagnosed with bipolar I a couple of years ago so this happens periodically. but this episode may be the worst I’ve ever had.. the suicidal thoughts have been constant for the past two weeks. When they’re not not in the forefront of my mind, they’ll creep up by the end of the day. I have no desire to follow through, but it’s just so overwhelming. it’s gotten to the point that late at night i start brainstorming what i would write in note to my family and close friends. I don’t have the means to follow through but I’m worried that if it gets any worse i’ll find a way. i’ve been considering seeking help but i’m scared. scared to miss work, scared to miss class (i’m in graduate school so attendance is crucial), and scared to stress my family out. The idea frightens me, but at the same time i am seriously struggling to function. i’m crying every day, i’ve pushed all my friends away, and feel worthless and alone. i’m not taking care of myself, i’m falling behind in school and literally all i can do is sleep the pain away. i feel like my mind is holding me prisoner. i’ve reached out to suicide hotlines the past couple of nights but they didn’t really help. I feel like i need to reach out for medical help, but i’m worried of what my family will think and worried that it might make things worse. so i guess the point of all this is to ask if anyone else has sought inpatient treatment, what it did for you, and how you coped with leaving your responsibilities behind for a bit.

side note: my birthday is in a couple of days, so that’s the primary reason i’ve been holding off on seeking help. shitty timing on my brain’s part, but i’m not sure i can wait any longer

I need some help with my friend,"My friend has recently opened up to me about a month ago about his depression and suicidal thoughts. He says that majority of the reason he feels this way is because he grew up feeling very alone and un loved, and used to speak to chairs and would sometimes hallucinate because of how lonely he felt. His old group of “friends” also dropped him one day without explanation, which really is what begun the seriousness of his situation as he began to blame himself. He now has a new group of friends including me who is loving and supportive and we’ve all been doing what we can to help, however he constantly keeps going back and reminding himself of his childhood and the days he felt lonely and it almost seems as if he his telling himself that he is alone no matter what we say to him. Any advice on what I can do/say to get him to stop focusing on the past and begin realizing he now has what he’s wanted his whole life, a group of loving friends who care about him? At times he says he does feel that we care and he says he loves us very much but I want him to just realize that constantly bringing up the past does nothing but make things worse and I just want him to understand he has what he says he wanted growing up, which is having caring people around him.

I can't do this anymore,"There's nothing in this world that can make me happy. I'm too broken. I've never been allowed to be happy, to be honest it was all probably doomed from the beginning, since the moment I took my first breath my life has been nothing but a punishment. My mind is a prison and so is this house, I have barely left it over the last year and this is what breaks me. I can't live with the pain of being myself, I deserve this after all. I know that in sitting here in my numbness feeling nothing but complete anguish, knowing that it's taking everything I got to write this, I know it's what I deserve. Why else would I be subject to this torment? I'm not a good person, I never have been. I'm a lying selfish bastard, I always have been...

I see my therapist once a month and my antidepressants don't work all the time and I just keep having to wait and wait for transitioning and I live in a house where I can't be myself and I live in a world where people see me as a freak just for being who I am... I can't get an ID even though I'm 18 so I can't get a job and the person I love lives halfway across the world and my depression isn't fair to her since I know she can't fix something that's too broken and my pain does nothing but hurt her and it's isn't fair...

Can't. Do this anymore... I need the strength to end it all right now but I'm too much of a coward. I can't get out of this house and I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. My mind has always been too broken, I don't function properly I don't remember things very well I'm not stable, I've never been stable. I can barely keep friendships and whenever I try to be a part of something, some group, anything, I make some mistake and I can't live with the shame and I can only ever think of how much they must find me annoying and how much they must not like me and how better it would be if I left... so I leave, and the process repeats. I always find myself somehow always going down the venting hole and that just makes me feel worse, I'm projecting my issues onto people I barely know and I know they can't fix it so what am I expecting to gain? I'm probably just some shitty attention whore and I need to learn to not be one. I need to keep punishing myself until one day I learn how to act like a normal person. Even if I don't leave said group after making the mistake of venting I know everyone will just get tired of me venting, it's happened before so it'll happen again. I also leave so that there isn't the opportunity for anyone to get tired of my constant depression and venting and ranting and blah blah it never ends... There's too much wrong with me to even begin to explain and even if I tried it wouldn't work because I don't know how. It's always problem after problem, there's too much to keep track of anymore. Everything just piles up until I can't take it anymore and then one little thing happens and I snap and everyone thinks I'm flipping out over this one little thing but no-one understands. No-one ever understands... I've lived my whole life being misunderstood and pushed to the side and treated like a child because I'm autistic. I've lived a life of trying to be who my parents want me to be and I can't take it anymore. Sure my step-father isn't in the picture anymore and my biological father may as well never exist, but he still had an impact on me. He instilled that toxic masculinity that made it so hard to accept myself as a trans woman. That's only the tip of the iceberg though. And then there's my mother, where everything I do is just never good enough. Always assuming and all that, blaming all my problems on my computer and my phone because that's what's easy. Always complaining how messy the house is when she doesn't even clean up after herself. Treating my depression like I'm just in a bad mood or some shit like that. I don't think I'll ever forget the day where I had a self-hate spiral and I was crying and as she left for work she told me ""don't forget to do the dishes today."" I know she doesn't care. Just a bit ago I was in my bed, barely moving because my depression has been hitting me so hard it is difficult to move. Granted, she didn't see that I was crying but she still just acted like I was choosing to act like a little twat... She'll never care. She's nice as long as I'm her 'good little boy' that does everything she says. I know she thinks I'm just a feminine man, she's even told me it before. She's told me that I will never be a real woman, and yet she pretends to be accepting sometimes. It's to the point where I do everything I can to avoid arguing with her. All arguments with her ends the same, with her telling me how much she sacrificed to be a good mother to me and my sister and/or she takes something away from me. I'm always hearing how *good* of a mother she was but from what I remember she didn't do a very good job. Sure she had her moments, she still does, but I will always remember how she would just sit outside and smoke all day while my sister tormented me and treated me like subhuman trash and blackmailed me to do what she wanted, nothing was mine and everything was hers. I know she feels bad for how she was and I know she's tried to get better but it doesn't change the past, it doesn't change how she treated me. Back to my mother, her go-to punishment is to take things away from me and I know the next time that happens she'll take away the internet or just my computer as a whole and I can't let that happen. Right now my connection to my girlfriend and the friends I do have is what's keeping me together right now. It's been what's kept me together since covid hit... And yeah I know I'm an adult and her taking those things from me would amount to taking my property but the truth is I'm too scared to stand up to her. The last time I did that I ended up sleeping on the floor and being locked out of my room until I complied... I remember that night. I was 16 and I was in a relationship she didn't approve of, and I did something that I don't remember what it was, probably argued with her about the relationship. All the time I would hear from my mother and sister how much they didn't like who I was with and how much of a ""unstable piece of shit"" my partner was... As you can imagine it got on my nerves rather quickly. That night in particular, she was going to take my phone away but I was terrified of her finding a way to get into it and going through my personal messages *because she has before.* She denies it but I know it happened. I remember being in middle school and my sister would take my ipod all the time to text her boyfriend and her other friends and well, me being the curious 6th grader that I was, I had tried to seek out porn in creative ways due to the parental lock. When my mother found out about my sister's relationship with that guy she went through the ipod knowing that she would use it all the time. And well, she found out that I had been trying to look for said material and was furious. She gave my sister and I a big long lecture about how her trust in us was broken and for a while after that we were barely allowed to do anything and she had set up something to record us while she was at work... But I'm getting off topic again. That night I refused to give her my phone ended rather poorly. I had a feeling she'd try to take it so I hid it from her in my room so she locked me out of my room until I decided I was going to give it up. I was pissed, as you can imagine. I don't quite remember what happened after that since I probably blocked it out but I remember standing outside in the backyard porch area in the cold crying because I was so upset. I remember when I finally came back inside she told me what I could sleep in the spare room/office since I wasn't allowed in my room. I slept on a mattress on the floor that was too small for me and I cried myself to sleep...

I don't even remember what the original point of saying all that was, but here I am. I know I can't get out of this house and I just want to fucking die, I see no way out of this. I can't hold on any longer I met my limit a long time ago... Maybe I won't end myself today but I can't see myself lasting very long.

I feel so alone with how I'm feeling,"I feel like I'm on autopilot every day

If I were to describe how I'm feeling, I would say... fuzzy? My head feels fuzzy.

Nothing bad has happened to me and i dont feel terrible. I just feel numb i think, I'm not even sure. I dont want to experience anything life has to offer. I don't want to graduate, I don't want a girlfriend, I don't want to get my own place to live, I don't want kids and I dont want a job. I feel so stupid with how I feel because I don't have a reason.

Life just feels so mundane every day. It's the same thing, every day, every week, every month, every year. I'm so bored with whatever I do. I have no joy.

I feel alone because all I hear from other people is that they feel so terribly sad and miserable when they're depressed. For me the reality is that I'm never really sad or happy. I feel nothing most of the time. When I am happy, i feel weird because... I dont know? I dont feel comfortable feeling happy and I can't help but feel comfortable whenever I'm slipping into another episode.

I used to suffer from severe anxiety, and that made me want to kill myself. Since taking meds, I don't feel it. I dont fucking KNOW how I feel and I'm just talking myself in circles here because I can't describe it.

I dont want anything. Life, death, anything. I dont want to try kill myself because I feel like that'll take too much effort to do right. I simply want to not exist, but even then that doesn't seem right to me. nothing seems right to me. Trying to explain everything makes my head feel weird.

All my life is is waiting until I can fall back asleep because only then I feel fine.

shit, can anyone relate? I feel so alone and distant from everything.",bodhi_mia,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovokgi/i_feel_so_alone_with_how_im_feeling/
I've figured it out. Things always suck.,I've cracked it. Life is actually a horrible time with little to no redeeming factors at all. None zero zip none none at all. Everything is a made up lie to try to suck every last ounce of happiness someone has and for others to take it for themselves. Nothing will ever make me happy or satisfy me.

Suicide note,"By the time you read this, I’ll no longer be around. I’ve left -redacted- as the executor of my will. I’m sorry to the few who care, for the grief and inconvenience I’ve caused. It’s no one’s fault that I’ve made this decision. 

A few of you may know some of my circumstantial struggles, but the roots of my suffering is existential. ‘He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how’. I’ve not found the why. I’ve been battling depression and trauma from sexual assault for decades, since I was 14. I’ve sought psychiatric help, and was medicated for a while. Depression is treatable, but not curable, and with each episode, I’ve exhausted my reserve of strength. I’ve done my best, and have delayed my departure as much as I could. As an atheist, I feel that death is final, so this was a decision I’ve made with a clear mind and a heavy heart. I’ve made peace with my decision. I hope with time, you may be able to accept my death too.

I have put my affairs in order. The executor will find my instructions in the will. I’ll like my body and organs to be donated after death, and for the funeral to be a simple affair.",Randomape-,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovluv4/suicide_note/

"Someone tell me it'll get better, please","I don't want to kill myself. But I wake up every day wishing I were dead, honestly. I made the mistake of getting addicted to weed and having reckless sex with someone and now I feel like my body is broken beyond repair. I've been having this irritation in my genitals for over 5 months and it doesnt seem to want to go away no matter what I do. and there's no explanation. I've seen so many doctors and had so many tests done but there's no real answer. 

I've tried exercising, meditating, taking probiotics, taking antibiotics, relaxing, laughing, doing what i love, distracting my mind... nothing is working. I'm living in constant discomfort and I don't know how to make it go away. I hate myself so much for getting addicted to drugs and having sex. I just graduated college at the end of 2020 and I was feeling GOOD and HAPPY and then i thought i'd do a good thing by quitting weed. of course a lot of stuff happened to me. but then this irritation in my genitals appeared and came and went constantly and now it's here and won't go away. I'm uncomfortable all the time. I even went and saw a doctor in NYC and was told just to let me body heal and that i'm fine, that i had an infection but it's all residual. But that was 2 months ago. I don't understand anymore. I feel cursed, like my body has been cursed to be like this forever. I'm desperately trying to distract myself too and be happy but it's NOT working. I thought it was. I was feeling a little better in the middle of this month but it's all coming back again. I was also feeling better in April but I'm so angry that i spent that whole month thinking I had HIV. 

I know it could be worse. I'm not in real pain. Just constant annoyance. That almost feels worse. If I could transfer this to be pain in my leg or back or something I would. At least pain tells you something. This is so mysterious. I just feel like I'm never going to be able to find my equilibrium again. I took having a normal body for granted for my entire life. Now i'm 27 and I feel like my life is over just when I wanted it to begin. 

I've been scouring so many subreddits and forums trying to see if someone has gone through something similar. Maybe but maybe not. I don't know. I know I sound like a paranoid psycho, and that's bc I probably am at this point. I just want to feel normal again and if I don't get back to normal I just wanna end it. This isn't a life, I don't want this if this is how i'm going to be forever. I'm trying so hard to envision a positive vision of the future (i'm usually a very optimistic person) and it is so hard to feel like I'll get there.

Someone just tell me it'll get better. I know I dont have any diseases. Nobody can find anything wrong. But it seems like it isn't my mind doing this bc i've been trying to relax for 2 months and nothing is really working. I don't know what to think anymore. Thanks in advance if you read this. I don't want to kill myself. But I can't imagine living like this forever.",theultralobster,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovlrqd/someone_tell_me_itll_get_better_please/
family therapists are actual shit,"I was forced to go there with my family. He didn’t give a fuck about me or what I wanted, only cared about why my parents were there. I was trying my best to make sure he didn’t know too much about me bc I knew for a fact that it wasn’t safe with him at all but somehow he fucking read my mind and guessed everything. now he’s suggesting taking everything (internet) away from me and I’m scared for myself bc I use it to distract myself, and without them all of my thoughts come back and it’s just not fun bc u get all of these urges. Idk what to do, I told my parents multiple times that I really don’t want to go there but hey don’t give a fuck.

and I have tried using other things to distract myself but the problem is that I get bored rly easily and my mind starts wandering unless it’s a constant stream of smth, like a video for example

i feel like i will lose soon,"i've been thinking for months now, and i think i am going to lose this battle i've been fighting with myself for years soon. i've tried therapy, antidepressants, i was even forced into an inpatient facility once. nothing has helped. in fact, it's only gotten worse. i've dealt with so much gaslighting that i can't even tell which of my memories are real and which are fabricated at this point. years and years of being called useless, annoying, dramatic, stupid, disappointing, etc. years of being told it won't get better and people like me don't make it out in the real world, and maybe she's right. on top of all that, my family gave me covid back in december. i still haven't gotten over it. everyone is telling me to let go, but how can i let go when the people who are supposed to protect me do this to me? i'm immunocompromised, and even then they didn't follow any regulations. 
the other day i overdosed. i'm pretty sure i had petit mal seizures, and i think i had a heart attack. all i know is my chest felt like someone was putting their hand in there and squeezing, and the pain radiated to my arms and jaw. i couldn't breathe. my heart rate was around 150 bpm. i could feel the fluttering and quivering. i thought it was likely i would experience ventricular fibrillation, and yet somehow i didn't. i've decided overdosing won't work. i have been thinking of another way, but i don't want my family to find me. i don't want my dogs to see, either.",bootlickerphobe,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovobkw/i_feel_like_i_will_lose_soon/

I really don't know how much more I could actually take anymore.,I've hit rock bottom and I don't care anymore if I live or die. I've been so work down I'm my 30 years of living from having fucked up parents to fucked up friends and just a fucked up way of thinking for far too long now. Ive finally had enough and I believe I finally found out a way to end it all. There's no love or anything from family or friends. I'm treated like shit everywhere. There won't be better days nor do I care how people would feel if I killed myself cause nobody gave a shit about me when I was here. This life could end and not one person would cry or feel sad that Im gone for good. I'm just fed up. I'll be gone before the new year rolls in. I just don't wanna live anymore I'm never happy. The thing I've loved doing no longer bring me joy. Im tired of hearing the same old shit life will het better and things could get worse but can it really? Why does my life have to be so bad? I don't believe in religion or God or the devil. I've lost the only people who I feel generally cared about me and that shit kills me. I really hope I don't wake up tomorrow.

Why did I have to live?,"January 15th of this year I shot my self with my grandmas glock 19. The bullets weren’t regular 9mm rounds either these were man killer rounds when that bullet penetrated my flesh it didn’t get implemented to my body like most bullets….when it entered it came out the other side. I attempted to shoot myself in the heart but unfortunately I missed aimed a little to far to the left. By the time it was all said and done I’d lost 5 pints of blood and had multiple strokes in my brain.  
And you know what I fucking survived yay what a fucking miracle. why God why did I have to live. So I guess the reason why I’m here is to ask you all is why did I live?

relapsing thoughts,"about 2 months ago I was in my car driving to the edge of a cliff that's well known in my town for the fact that 6 people (and a dog?) have committed suicide by jumping off of. Before I could, I got a few calls in the car, and ended up going to a mental health Rehabilitation facility instead. it was nice there but it felt like I was in a cage and I ended up leaving my program early.

i went into PHP and everything was going alright, ups and downs of course but generally, I felt like I was getting better. I went back to work at my part-time job i literally couldn't afford not to go back to. its at a movie theater and cleaning up after the hedonistic slobs that leave their shit in the theater didn't help me.

I'm also a pot smoker, up until lately because now i don't have two nickels to rub together. so the thing that i was using to numb the pain is outside of my reach (i cant drink) and i feel shitty asking to use other people's supply.

it feels like the only people who would notice if i killed myself are my boyfriend and my dog. and even with them, i can never fully enjoy my time because of the major depressive disorder and anxiety, I'm medicated and it helps a bit but i feel like I'm the problem. I feel like I'm dragging down my boys mood constantly and making him support me more than any reasonable partner should.

talking to people doesnt help me, my automatic defenses kick in of feeling like a burden and so i pretend everything is alright. im really good at pretending now.

I tried to plan ahead for the future to give myself something to hold on to, but everywhere i go to apply for college loans would rather i do kill myself than give me a loan without a cosigner. and the people who i would ask to cosign are to busy being as actively neglectful as they have been for the last 20 years. So i'm probably about to get dropped from any of my future hopes of doing what i would want to with life.

For a few days I had an internship in the field I want to work in, but I got let go from that after my second day working

I’ve only been helped once to get out of bed, the other times I have had to slide out on my left side which came better off after my accident. 
It’s not that I want sympathy, bunches of flowers and to start getting affection I never had from my family to be begin with but I feel like I’m more of a burden and that it’s disrupted their life for a few days which makes me even more regrettable about not going faster or harder. I know they don’t want me to die but I thought their actions would match their first words after the accident a bit more. 
Dad said on the way home from the hospital don’t do it again and definitely don’t crash a car again like that and that there’s other ways to do it and it’s making me think of another way…

Road to Redemption,"Dear SuicideWatch,

It's been about a year since I first started experiencing suicidal thoughts. It all happened really quickly and I didn't know how to process it. I decided to come here to r/SuicideWatch to speak my mind, in the hope that I could get an answer about how to move forwards without taking my life. Even though I didn't know anyone who replied, I remember finding it really difficult to make this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hlvtx6/justice/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hlvtx6/justice/) 

I know it sounds cliché, but speaking to someone about how you feel can really help out. It allows you to gain some perspective from another person. More importantly, it prevents you from keeping your difficult thoughts to yourself. I think loneliness/solitude can really make dealing with suicidal thoughts unbearable. Having just one person that you can confide in can truly do wonders. I'm a bit of a mess making this post right now, so I'm sorry that the structure is a bit all over the place. 

I still have suicidal thoughts now. However, they get to me much less often than they did a year ago. I've figured out ways to tolerate them and not overthink them too much. Oftentimes, we don't completely move past grief, but we grow around it. I can't forget my thoughts, but I can handle them a lot better now. It can get better. I can't guarantee that it will, but it can. 

I started helping out here on r/SuicideWatch. I know it sounds very dramatic, but I mainly did it to ease my conscious. I talked about it a bit on the linked post, but I did something terrible to someone when I was younger. Processing this led me down a really bleak moment in my life. Everything seemed hopeless. I couldn't see myself moving forwards. I felt like I was deceiving everyone around me. It was almost unbearable. 

I can't say that it got better straight away, if anything it got worse. I broke down a lot initially. Mostly in secret, as I didn't want to disturb anyone. If you're trying to get over something, giving yourself time to grieve and breakdown is so important. Without doing this, you're harbouring thoughts that can be really draining on you in the long term. It all peaked for me around this time last year. I don't think it got worse past early August.

I continued to help out here in order to earn my redemption. However, the more I reached out to people who had posted, the more my reasoning for helping out changed. I was initially trying to redeem myself through my actions, but I saw a fantastic quote that gave me a lot of clarity.  “A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward.”― **George R.R. Martin**  Any good act I do isn't cancelled out by my past, but it's important to appreciate that any bad in my past isn't washed out by any good either. 

It gave me a healthier outlook on redemption. I no longer had this massive ""redemption debt"" that I had to pay back with good deeds. My new road to redemption simply involves trying to do what's right wherever I can. This involved publicly speaking up about my mental health at one point. I know there's a lot of stigma surrounding this, but I felt like I had a responsibility to challenge said stigma. If there was a single person in my circle who needed to hear what I had to say, then I didn't mind making myself all vulnerable on social media. However, this made me break down again, as it was really difficult opening up like that to so many people.

From that point onwards, I've mostly been okay. There have been days where I've really, really struggled, but these were mostly isolated incidents. ""Time heals all wounds"", so they say. I'm not sure how true this quote is, but it seems to be true for my suicidal thoughts. This is just my opinion, but it slowly gets better. I wish I could promise this, but I don't want to make empty promises to anybody.

I still need to apologise to the person that I hurt, but I haven't worked up the courage to do that just yet. I still have a long way to go on my road to redemption, but I'm getting closer to where I need to be. The reason why I wanted to share my thoughts today was because I wish I heard from someone who was in a similar position to me this time last year. If you're struggling with your past and you need someone to talk to, please drop a comment down below. 

I'm going to bed now, but if this post helps just one person who has gone through something similar, then I'm happy. I can also provide more redemption advice. I'm going to make a thorough post at some point. Goodnight everyone, take care.",RainonSmoke,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovi3c4/road_to_redemption/
Every piece of my life has turned bad,"I’m being pressured on the daily by my boyfriend of seven years to get married and have a baby. But I’m terrified. I’ve been unhappy in the relationship but can’t get out (guilt, financials, living alone in a state together). I can’t commit. 

My small business is dwindling to nothing. A sharp decline in income for the last 6 months and I’m barely scraping by. 

I have a masters degree in psychology but zero will to try to help people/work in the field. I don’t think I can handle it when I feel deteriorated. My social anxiety is so crippling that I don’t think I could have the brain function to work in a high stress environment. 
Oh! Student loan payments should be kicking in soon. 

My mother is a raging alcoholic who won’t quit despite being hospitalized every two months. Ive been working so hard with her to get her help but she won’t do it. Why can’t she be the mom I need? She was my best friend but now we rarely talk. 

My boyfriend is also an alcoholic, who drinks til he passes out and drives to get more beer after I go to bed. I had to bail my mom out of jail for a DUI at 17 and don’t want to have to do it for my boyfriend. 

I feel so behind in my life. Everyone asks me about my career path but with everything going on I can’t even start to focus on it... I don’t want to. 

In the last five years I’ve began to think I don’t want marriage or children at all. No matter who it was with.

Since I was 6 years old I’ve been suffering from OCD which then developed to POCD at age 14. 

When I was 12-13 years old I was a weird kid and was bullied. I started cutting my self and have been planing to kill my self in the near future. I do have friends and I am a sociable guy but I just don’t see a future for myself. 

The intrusive thoughts are driving me crazy and burning me from the inside, and some times I just can’t take it anymore. 

I don’t want to kill myself, because I don’t want my family and friends to think I left them. I just wish to be die naturally but soon.

Does anyone ever feel like you just want the world to know you existed after you’ve gone?,"I’m such a loser lol. I’ve ruined my body by being fat for so long and now that I’ve lost the weight my body has been ruined. My mental health is complete dog shit and I have BPD. The only reason I don’t kill myself is because of my sister.

Now that the pre amble is outta the way. I see a lot of people I went to high school with have died or committed suicide. In these posts about them so many people recognize them and share memories of them and they actually seem like people cared for them and will remember them. For example a kid who killed Him self when we where in 6th grade is still talked about and mourned to this day and we are in our early 20’s now. 

My entirelife I’ve been over looked and forgotten I’ve never had many friends and I don’t have any now. But I feel like before I fade outta existence I want people to know I existed that I was here. One last “fuck you I existed” to the world. I don’t have many people who would mourn me. I’m jealous of other people who have many people who would remember them.

I am so fucked and suicide seems like the only way out.,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 16 months. I think we moved too fast. She’s my first girlfriend and my love for her is genuine. I think we got wrapped up in how right the relationship felt and jumped the gun on moving in together. We’ve been living together for nearly a year. I sacrificed a really comfortable living situation with my best friend to move in with her. He has since taken a new roommate and there is no room for me to return. 

Over the past year though, fighting has become more and more common, to the point where I am genuinely questioning if I made the right call with her. I just feel like everything I do is wrong. We bit off a hair more than we could chew with our rent situation as we were in a rush to move after we got robbed at our old place. So every now and again I must take some extra shifts at work to ensure I can make my half of the bills. It’s not that financially strained, but the extra shifts are a necessary evil. This causes fights between us. There’s a lot of double standards in this relationship. She is free to spend her time as she pleases, but if I want to take an extra shift, it’s a whole thing. Trying to communicate my feelings with her results in a fight. She says I don’t listen to her feelings. I try, but whenever she has a grievance with me, it can’t just be a talk, it’s gotta jump straight into a fight. One where I’m always made to be the bad guy. She insists that she misses me and wants to spend time with me, but when we have time to spend together, she will find the first opportunity to get mad at me. 

I’m just so confused. I do love her. But I don’t love always being made to feel I’m in the wrong. I don’t love the double standards, and I don’t love always having to walk to the beat of her drum. I want this to work. I genuinely feel that when things are good, they outweigh the bad. I try to show my love in various ways. She comes home to a clean house most days, I treat her to dinner and the like fairly often, and I sometimes get her random little gifts. She insists I don’t support her, but I feel I do. Maybe our definitions of support are different. But I feel the break-up coming. In her mind, this is who I am: the selfish asshole.

Today’s fight consisted of me telling her I’d need to work tomorrow. That blew up and became a bigger fight about who supports who, pulling weight around the house, and a bunch of other stupid shit. We were to go to a party today and she ended up going without me, basically leaving me to my thoughts. 

So that alone isn’t reason enough to consider suicide. But if this break-up happens, I am screwed. I don’t make enough to feasibly live by myself in a location that works with my job and school with enough space for myself and my two cats. I certainly can’t afford this place by myself, and as I mentioned, returning to my living situation with my best friend is no longer an option. I should stress that this financial worry is not my primary reason for wanting to avoid a break-up. I genuinely love my girlfriend and would do mostly anything for her. It’s just that we’re this to occur, it would be cataclysmic for me. I’m so close to finishing my degree, but I would have to shelve it if I had to live by myself. It would just be such a waste. I’ve held a 4.0 the entire time I’ve been in school. My hard work was finally going to pay off, but it’s seeming like a distinct possibility that my academic career will be on hiatus soon. 

So yeah, I just feel really fucked. I know my thoughts here aren’t terribly well organized, and I apologize for that. I’m usually a better writer than this, but I’m just not in a good place right now.",Radnostiv,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovf1wt/i_am_so_fucked_and_suicide_seems_like_the_only/
41 yo military vet,"I have been depressed and suicidal for about 25 years.i think about it daily. I fully understand that it will hurt a lot of people. Like a lot of people one minute in laughing and having a good time and the next a switch is flipped. Just before covid hit my company fired me for calling out too much, my fault I fully accept it, due to family troubles and not having a note from a dr excusing the absences. I had been working for the company for 10 years and was told over and over that my cooking was bad but when people ate my dishes they loves them. Which has lead me to more and more self doubt. Being a cook has been incredibly difficult during covid. The only thing that has ever brought me joy was/is cooking. I have been a 'failure' most of my life and that feeling has gotten worse and I just want to truly give up. I know that getting a job anything, havent worked in 21 months , will help with my mental state but I'm too depressed and stuck in my own head to so anything and honesty.

I attempted and everyone sees me differently now,"Sit tight.. It’s kinda long;

I was suicidal for years, but I started this medication to treat my symptoms for depression and possible BPD (?) that honestly I feel heightened everything I felt. I truly did not have a happy moment anymore, and was incredibly manic. I felt insane. 

I went on a trip to see my friends from online, this was huge for me because they are such a loving and caring group of people that Im so lucky to have met.. But even on the trip, I had my moments where I would cry and isolate myself.

One day while I was with them, they all went into the store to get some food for the camping trip we were gonna go on. I decided to stay in the car, alone, because I was just not having it. Eventually.. My impulses became too strong. I did not think about ANYTHING. My mind was telling me to take as many of my pills I could, don’t care about the consequences, just do it.

(Im not 100% sure if my intention was suicide or to just get a high, regardless it was fucking stupid.)

They kicked in when we arrived at the campgrounds, and everyone had to watch me be barely conscious, falling, vomitting..

They took me to the hospital and 2 of them stayed with me until my mom came, I love them so much and they hold no judgements.

I could’ve died if I took only a few more.

After this experience, I really want and HAVE to change. I view almost everything positively and I refuse to fall back down again. 

The issue is, nearly everyone around me just doesn’t see ME anymore. They see a fragile, mentally ill girl who tried to kill herself in front of her friends.


I dont want to say I hate myself but, I absolutely despise that person I was and feel strongly that it had to do with the medication I was on (effexor). Two of my newly made friends think Im unstable and dont even wanna be around me anymore, my  other friends’s families are not comfortable around me, and I just feel like I cannot escape that old me. 


Ive wasted everything before I could even experience it.


Im writing this to shed some light onto this issue because Im sure its common, and its for those who are struggling with the same issue. What I did, mediccational or not, was vile and disturbing for everyone and Id give everything I have to go back and prevent it. Even f you feel no one cares, just know its false and you wiuld be surprised by how many people love and care for your existence. Appreciate yourself and others more, trust me, you can lose it all so easily and sit with that loss.. Its the worst feeling possible.


TLDR;; I overdosed near my friends because of a very bad mental/manic episode (idk, it just wasn’t me making that decision 100%) and now everyone judges me and holds me to that incident, which I understand and find valid, I just don’t know how to cope.",bugbuttz,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovjhv5/i_attempted_and_everyone_sees_me_differently_now/

I am 14 years old and believe I have developed a cocaine addiction and fucked everything up. Suicidal,"
Let me preface by saying that I’m only 14, turning 15 in august. let’s just say the people I grew up around fucked me up and so did (do) my current friends. The city that I live in, in the third world country known as the United States really doesn’t help either (cheap drugs, poverty, extremely depressing overall, a lot of people start using at my age) But really only have myself to blame

When I was 11, I was introduced to weed by my brother. I loved it and became a daily smoker at that age. Not long after, I was introduced to shrooms.

Again, loved it and a year later, at age 12 I tried acid for the first time. I fell in love with psychedelics and took acid/shrooms almost monthly for a while. 
Took a break from psychedelics and weed after it caused hefty derealization.

Only a week ago, my ex girlfriend (15) who has recently become a massive coke addict, invited me over to do coke with her. I was hesitant about it but I wanted to see what it’s like. We binged about .5 that night, no euphoria, barely even more intense than a couple cups of coffee, loved the drip however. 

Extremely boring and pointless feeling, but every 10 minutes all I wanted was another line. Ended up having unprotected sex as I had zero inhibition which risks aside, made me feel like a total piece of shit as I’m currently in a very happy relationship with my girlfriend (16) and have been for 9 months.

When the comedown hit, I felt an overwhelming wave of shame, along with wanting more coke. Lied to her and told her I missed a dose of my meds and went home because i was so ashamed of myself

I spent the entirety of the next day sucking the coke residue off the post it notes that we used to snort it with. Promised myself I’d never do it again and felt like a total piece of shit, was kind of using the leftover coke to combat the shame I was feeling. Also freaked the fuck out about pregnancy and bought an ec pill for her, which she refused to take. 

I forgot about coke until yesterday when she texted me asking to come do more coke. I was reminded of what I felt on it (albeit barely anything at all) and accepted. 

Gave her $50 for coke, which was all the money I had, which I was saving for a new guitar pedal. Guess what? Same exact thing happened. The exact same thing I promised I’d never do again. We did about half the bag and again realized what I had done.

I went home which she literally begged me not to do, but I just couldn’t fucking stay there, it was less about the coke but more about the fact that I was with her, someone who I promised myself I would cut out of my life and once again cheated on my fucking girlfriend. It’s currently 4am and I’ve spent the whole night sucking on the post it notes and snorting random white specks off my clothes. 

I left the bag at her house and she’s asking me to hang out tomorrow to finish off the bag and I really don’t know if I have the willpower to decline it. 

These are the only two times I’ve done coke, I had no idea how horrible this drug is. Is my life already ruined? These are the only two times I’ve done this, but am I already captured? Did I fuck everything up?

What the fuck do I do? As I’m writing this I am having a full blown panic attack, can’t stop thinking about how I cheated on my girlfriend, wanting more coke, worrying that I got her pregnant and wondering if I’m already fucked. I don’t think I’m full on addicted yet, so there may still be time. I am a pretty promising musician, released a couple albums that people like and get decent grades. I literally don’t know how I can carry on, what am I going to do?

I posted this to a sub for quitting coke but I was shamed and mocked.

I really don’t care if you judge me, I know that I’m a piece of shit.",hddishdjsnxjd,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovdnkd/i_am_14_years_old_and_believe_i_have_developed_a/
Looking back,"I first became suicidal when i hit 13 and my asperger symptoms fully kicked in. Now im 27. I have a pretty foolproof way i could kill myself any time i wanted, painlessly.

What if i had killed myself, lets say 10 years ago, back when i was a kid who didnt understand jack shit about the world, or myself, in comparison to the person i am today? It feels like an important viewpoint to consider and the only real answer to the question: ""SHOULD i do it""? What's the answer? 

Meh. It doesnt matter how much more educated you get, how much better your cognition gets, how much more powerful you get etc. You, I, never get over the horror of it all. Of existing. And thats the point. Once you dont feel that constant dread anymore, you have become a part of it. Without any ability to perceive yourself the way you are.

What I live is not a life,"Everyday for the last 9 months I'm surrendered to my ocd, my panic, my depression, my paranoia. Everyday I follow a schedule and I do the same compulsions and I live in fear not forget something. I don't eat and sleep properly, I have many psysical pains, I forgot what us like to sit in your room and just surf to a pc, read a book or watch a movie. Everyday I just sleep, wake up, eat something and go out for walking and stay outside from house. Then I stay in my moms car for 2-3 hours, come home and lay on bed. I can't find a job, go to a doctor or do anything else because of this. Everyday I just think how to end my life.

This just the result of my awful life. I have struggle with so many things and never thought it can go deeper but guess I was wrong. There is not a day that I didn't think that this is my last one I just dekay the inevitable. Between ptsd and depersonalization there us no way to come back in real life as a normal person and I refuse to take again medication and go to fucking therapists. They damaged me enough for 8 years.

This is not a life. Nobody can't live this way. Just because I have a home and parents who give me money and I sleep and eat it doesn't mean that I'm better than others. Everyday is a living nightmare. The only person I talk to is my mother but she is useless she can't do anything to stop me or say something helpful it's too late. And I just become violent towards her everytime I remember something from the past.

I can't understand what I expect. A miracle probably but there is no way to get out of it. I waste my time with reddit and youtube and trying to predict the future but I can't last anymore. There is no point to tell everything that is going wrong with me and how much I torture and neglect myself, the result is the same. I'm not dead inside yet but I don't feel alive.

I wish just someone wanted to help and take care of me, sit with me for hours and built a schedule to help me. Not a therapist because who therapist could watw his life to cone and save me?

I was able to ignore this constant feeling of dread and sadness but nothing works anymore,"I've been thinking about suicide daily for the last 10 years. It wasn't always easy, but for the most part I could turn that part of my mind off and just enjoy things, even if its mindless entertainment just so I wouldn't have to think at all. 

But lately I have this constant feeling of dread, it's as if someone just told me a loved one of mine died, and I can't shake it off. I feel miserable all the time, my sleep schedule is messed up because I have to watch movies on my phone until I can't keep my eyes open, otherwise I'll just spend 2 or 3 hours wide awake in bed agonizing about everything. How quickly time passes is one, I'm 25 and I can't stop thinking how in a few months I'll turn 26, then 27, then 30. The last 4 years are a blur for me, it passed so fast that I can't even comprehend it. Things that I thought happened last year happened 3 years ago. If it was so fast until now, Im' basically dead already, and I didn't even had a chance to be happy. Life feels so pointless. The more I think of it, the more it feels as if we're never really in the present, its like Im floating above watching me go through my life.

I have no work or life experience, I never did anything fun with friends because I never had any. Im going old and I didnt even enjoyed my youth, and my old age is going to be miserable. I'll have to kill myself after my parents pass away because I cant even take care of myself financialy.  I keep thinking that all of these generations managed to be normal, until it reached me and I'm a freak who can't do anything. All I wanted was to be happy and have a family of my own but I'm trans and now it's too late to do anything about it. I feel terrible that my parents are watching their peers with their normal adult children why I seem to be mentally stuck at 15. I went to therapy for a couple of years and it only made me better at hiding my feelings and just delayed this meltdown I'm having. I don't have a moment of enjoyment, all of these worries are going on 24/7 in my mind and its turning me crazy.

Insomnia is making me slowly lose my will to live.,"Hello, I am 15 (M) and my sleep is all sorts of fucked up. I've asked my mom to take me to the doctor over this because its been over a month and a half since I've had good sleep but she really just doesn't give a fuck about me. I would have to break a arm before she would even think about taking me to the doctor, she thinks she knows everything when she doesn't. Melatonin seems to have the opposite effect, it makes it easier to fall asleep but I wake up every hour or so which means I am getting somewhere around half of the sleep I should be. 

I just want to have 1 good night of sleep and I don't know how much longer I can put up with this before I just hang myself, this shit is just making me lose it all. I can't concentrate, I am just constantly zoned out in my thoughts of offing myself, constant headaches, my mind feels foggy this is just the worst. Even when I get sleep I wake up unrested. I've lost all interests in the things that I used to like and this just feels like hell.

I have 7 siblings, 4 of which are currently living in the same house as us so its very hard for me to want to talk about emotional problems with my mom because that is a lot of vulnerability even if its my siblings I don't think I can take being judged for my emotions. I've put a front of being this joking, happy 15 year old but in the inside I am just a complete fucking mess, extremely insecure about my height, face, voice basically everything. Which really isn't helping me in the whole not wanting to die department. If I were to off myself I wouldn't care how my siblings would feel only my mother, my sibling are constant assholes to me but my mom is obviously my mom so I don't know.

Self harm is something I'm deeply ashamed about and its not helping that I have to wear a coat in 90 degree weather constantly which just makes me want to die more while I wait for cuts to heal to the point where they are unnoticeable. My mom keeps all of her knives locked up so I have to use this small razor, Which thank god for by the way. I just am not thinking straight when im in the mindset of wanting to self harm and several times I am searching for something more sharp so I can cut deeper. 

Its gotten so bad recently, I wouldn't mind if someone shot me in the face or ran me over. Turning 16 soon so I guess that's cool but I just wanna die if I'm being honest. It wouldn't be murder it would be a mercy kill. I would rather die then feel this pain inside that I can't show on the outside. No ambition or purpose or anything just living to live, constantly waiting for it to get better and it gets worse always. Can someone just tell me otherwise? I mean life is pretty cool on paper but I don't know how much more of this I can take before I just off myself. Ive never had any form of validation while growing up, no support, my dad is a complete asshole that left my life a long time ago but he made sure to fuck up my head before he left. Even with my family being religious I'm not even scared of hell, mainly because I just think its all horseshit because why would someone bring me here just to suffer?

I just want to rant and tell someone how I feel.,"I'm a wife and a mother, I also had a terrible childhood that left me with co-depenence and trauma. Today I'm diagnosed with AvPD.

Some people know I have mental illness, nobody knows how much I think about death.. I can't tell anybody.
The only reason I won't die is because of my kids, and they are also the reason I won't tell anybody about what I feel.

But some days I just wish I didn't have kids so I could die, it's like I'm waiting for them to grow up and move out so I finally can get peace.

I love my kids and I want them to have the best life, and I should be happy and healthy for their sake.. But I can only pretend and wait.

I almost died once, I was bleeding out inside my body and the doctor said ""one more day and you would have died"".. 

Having a huge bloodloss was the most peaceful I ever felt, it was like everything just poured out, even feelings.. 
So I often dream about dying in sickness or an accident, that I would get away with and it would be less hurtful for my kids.

Because of my AvPD I'm a real worthless creaute, I know I will never live normal and I just can't fucking stand being a burden anymore.
But my kids need me, I know that.. But at the same time I'm afraid they feel what I feel and they take after me.. I don't want that.. I do talk with them. ""I'm just stressed"" ""I'm a bit sad, but it's okey to be sad and it will go away""..

But I think my talk can hurt them because it's all the time.. I'm ""sad for the moment"" all the time.. 
I'm not alone in this tho, I have my husband and I know If I break he will be with them.
But they love me and need me.. It's so so so hard..",XYYV,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovkgas/i_just_want_to_rant_and_tell_someone_how_i_feel/
Just trying to get through this,"Hi; I’m a 30 year old mom of three (had my first kid at 19) and am just struggling with a failing marriage because my husband won’t listen to my problems (literally laughed at me a week ago because I was trying to get through an anxiety attack) and my “friends and family” don’t give a shit.

I was diagnosed with Boarder line personality disorder two years ago (on top of depression and major anxiety) after an almost two year court battle (still waiting to testify which is coming this march; might as well add my mother, who was married to this man, who disowned me for almost two years and still talks to him and pays for his lawyer) with my step father who sexually assaulted me from the age of 9 to almost 14, until I cut my hair to look like a boy so he would leave me alone. 

I had a regression dream that it would happen to my daughters so I stood my ground and pushed them out of my life, which I feel is justified. I saved my girls from a monster.

Now, I have no one; no friends, my husband is aloof and doesn’t care, and my family just wants it behind them to keep their “image” and won’t even talk to me about it. 

All I have is my children; they are my fucking world. I honestly wouldn’t be here if I didn’t have them.

I am also a cutter and have struggled with suicidal thoughts my whole life; but I can’t say that for fear of my kids getting taken away from me. My step father called child services on me after I made my police statement about the assaults. 
I’m a damn great mom and just need advice. 

I have gone through therapy all my life (child of a messy divorce) and no one is in my corner anymore. My sister literally told me I was a bitch today because I was asking for help.

I’m at the end of my rope and just need some validation that I can make it. I know you don’t know me and my struggles and I’m not asking for sympathy… I just need to know that my life is worth living.

When I was a little boy, my parents fought very often. My father was an alcoholic, and my mother wasn't satisfied with him, she wanted a life of luxury. They got divorced. I've been told that my mother didn't even want to have me, but I didn't believe any of them, as I've loved my mother and hated my father. The day comes when I have to make the choice in court with whom to stay, my mother tells me that life would be hars with her, I should do whatever I want. The intent in her voice clearly said she didn't want me. I was mortified. My whole childhood flashed before me, and I saw my mother, I saw the truth, she was never actually there. Most of her free time she'd go out to cheat on my father hoping she'd hook a bigger fish, and leave me home with a can of food.  
 My father's turn comes, it was all scripted, he said you make your own choice, but I knew he didn't want me, he even said to my family that I should go with my mother, but they guilted him into taking me. Not because they cared about me, but because it would be a bad image for the family. I had no choice but to go with him, it's in his house that I grew up.   


I've been told growing up that I was a smart kid. But nobody wanted to help me. I was lost, I felt alone, confused. Couldn't focus on studying, struggling. Nothing came out of it. Other members of the family hated me, even openly. The thought that I was better than their own kid ticked them off, said I did nothing to deserve it and only cheated.   


My cousin (she) hated me the most, but for a different reason. For being my mother's son. My mother envied her for being prettier, better at hooking old rich guys, and called her a whore, after she told my father that my mother was cheating on him. Having an explosive personality and a short fuse, it immediately turned violent, physical. This was the fight that started the divorce. My life was a living hell because of my cousin. She hated my guts. Every time she'd come in town she'd yell at me, threaten me with physical violence and forced me to follow her and do her chores. When I was 17 or so, this only got worse. She threatened to throw me out of the house, to go homeless if I didn't work for my family's company. I had no choice, too horrified to tell anyone. The hours were excruciating, and while I wasn't laying bricks, the work was still hard and the pay was dogshit. I develop an illness, most likely from the fear, depression and anxiety (since the bacteria that normally causes this was ruled out) and she could no longer force me to come. I had to get treatment. I tried confining in my family what she had done to me at this point, hinting for a long time about it, but none of them believed me. They brushed me off.   


I never felt so betrayed.    


School finished, and I'm without a job for almost a decade. Crippled with anxiety, useless, with nothing to offer. A parasite, but a very low maintenance parasite that they can use, which is why I wasn't yet discarded. Never once in my life had they asked for my consent on responsibilities they wanted to shove down my throat. Forced to take care of their kittens, since they wanted cats. Love them dearly, the animals have no fault of their own, and have grown out to be the most beautiful cats our family ever had, but I despise that I have no choice.   


My father ? Well my father only got worse, alcoholism then and now, he's way worse. Threatened to kill me multiple times, even heard him taking this year of driving the car with me and killing the both of us.    


At this point I'm too tired to even flesh everything out.   


I'm a 27 year old virgin, I regret missing out on the most fun years of my life. Now at my age, most people are settling down. I missed out on everything. I've hated my own body for my whole life, but I think a lot about sex, I hate the fucking irony. I have nothing to offer. No cash, no future, no personality and lazy as fuck. The thought of catering to one more person's needs in my life horrifies me.   


No skills. Social, or work related. Basically something of a mute irl. Can't work hard jobs. Won't work hard jobs, but don't have studies to get me a good job.   


Wanted to relearn math, but how ? I don't have time. Fear paralyzes me. I can't focus on anything. I don't understand why. Simple tasks like cleaning the kitchen take me more than half a day instead of 2 hours, I have to read stuff 5-6 times before I can even understand what I read, and it takes me days to even start tasks. I fidget all the time, my mind always goes different places, can't even focus in a conversation. It's all so confusing.  
 

Is this it ? Is this life ? Being expected to break my back for some measly sum of cash ? I don't want it.   


Freedom can only be bought. My illnesses can only be fixed with cash. Everything would be better with money, but it's just not worth it.   


I think I'm broken. I'd rather die than struggle another day in my life like I did in my one and only job.   


I can no longer wait for my grandmother to die anymore, I need to get out, she didn't even help that much, I need to buy the gas tank.   


I hate everything. I regret everything. Seriously fuck this joke that's called a gift. I can't wait to get out. I can't wait to be finally fucking free. I will finally be free. I will finally be my own. Finally nobody can tell me what to do. I can finally get my own way in life. For once in my whole life I can get something that I wanted without begging or having others use me. I can finally have some quiet. Finally I can get away from the dirt. It's always so fucking dirty, why is it so fucking dirty all the fucking time. Why is it never clean why is it always me nobody can blame me anymore for things i dont have to fear anymore i dont have to pretend to care anymore. I can finally be my own man.",tempacoconut,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovgxyq/finally_i_will_be_free_ive_waited_far_too_long_to/

I made a journey today,"Today was an awful day after an awful week in an awful month of an awful year in my awful life. A couple of months ago I ended my relationship by being a piece of shit that prefered drowning in his own depression, sorrow and bad memories, compensated by scrolling through an ig feed full of bi\*\*hes, instead of being actually happy with what I have. A long journey of pain and suffering since then, led to a full week of incredible back pain from a work accident and my self inflicted headaches. I have months of therapy behind me, mainly focusing on my addictions, tendencies to destroy myself and the endless thoughts of killing myself out of so many reasons. Sadness, loniless, anger, desperassion, guilt and pure revenge on the people that sometimes also were assholes to me.

Yesterday was a day I spent crying for hours, with little breaks in gaming or trying to watch a movie that I didnt give a shit about. So today I woke up and tried to have a normal day. I couldnt. I watched another movie again that I discovered recently and loved a lot. I listened to a little bit of music and wanted to meet the person that I love for the last time, because I made up my mind. I'm gonna visit her and a few places and then I fuck off of this world for good. Best for everybody. She wasnt there. Didnt really respond properly on phone, until not at all anymore. I dont even know where she was butr since she didnt want to tell me its probably what I'm thinking since months. Theres another man. Or several. Even if she is just having fun with friends, she ignores my plead for help. And that made me mad. I visited the spot where I always met with my, now deceased, best friend/sisterfromanothermother/guardian/soulmate/overall\_best\_person\_I\_ever\_met and wrote my love a last message. 

I drove around a bit and after one or two hours I found a bridge. Its a pretty high bridge on the highway. I parked my car and sat on the barrier a little bit. Long. Thinking about all my life, the good things and all the horrible thigns that changed me into a person that neither myself nor my girlfriend could ever really love, or even like. I was reaching the end and my mind was made up.. I was ready.

A car parked behind mine. A woman stepped out and asked my if everything was ok. I was already sitting on the reiling, which has to look insane to a normal person, since the bridge is easily between 50-100 meters high. She asked if everything was ok. I responded it will be. Well to cut this a little bit short, she talked me into talking to her and I told her a lot about myself. Well in the end, she said she would feel sad if I would not continue. So here I am. Feeling more guilt, freezing because it was raining and I literally had only a shirt and shorts on and still not knowing which piece of shit is probably fucking the love of my life atm after she had an awesome fucking saturday evening and night. And I'm at the same fucking spot, I was yesterday. And tomorrow, I will be at the same fucking spot that I was today. 

The thing that I am really, really mad about right now, is my fucking cowardness of not just FUCKING SHOWING EVERYONE THAT I MEAN IT! THAT I AM NOT PLAYING! THAT IT HAS TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BEFORE EVERYONE STANDS AROUND A FUCKING GRAVE SAYING SHIT LIKE WE DIDNT SEE IT COMING! WHY WOULD HE DO THIS?

Venting,"I get into these moods where I seriously consider suicide. I thankfully get out of them, but venting helps me a lot. My friends won't talk to me right now because I moved away without a goodbye. I have people here being nice to me but I feel like they're just fake being nice because they don't check on me or anything. Im supposed to go to church in the morning to see some of them and I just do not know how to put on a fake smile. I have had to be so strong through absolutely horrible things lately and I don't know what to do. This person rented a hotel room for me for a week, the person at church. It is so nice and so loving and kind. But deep down I feel like I don't deserve it and that they hate me. He is a landlord and could have rented a house out to me but decided to give it to someone else. I am a young woman living in my car. I don't even understand why I try to be honest. I gave up my pets to move out here, the only souls that truly loved me. My dogs probably got put to sleep because I had to give them to a shelter because I was living in my car for 2 months. I have nightmares constantly. I can't even go anywhere else because my car is breaking down. The transmission is so fucked up so I am just enjoying it while it lasts. I have a job but only get paid every 2 weeks. It is just so difficult. I wake up alone every night and go to sleep alone. I haven't had sex with a guy in over a year. And I got pregnant and had a miscarriage.  I haven't even had a guy hold me or be nice to me for a long, long time. That guy was a terrible boyfriend. I don't even trust peoples kindness anymore. I don't even have people ask me anything about myself. They just sit there and talk about themselves the whole time. Its like I am invisible. I just wish I had a guy to hold me even for a night and listen to me. I have had such a hard life. I even feel ashamed for having these feelings. I would kill myself if I wasn't so lazy to be honest, because I know how hard it is to complete suicide and I feel like it wouldn't work for me unless I did something super serious, or knowing me, God would make me survive just to make me suffer and laugh at my stupid ass. Everyone schemes against me and even if I do something out of love or just genuine care and concern it is taken the wrong way. I can't even be myself. I wish I had a real friend. I know a lot of people here feel the same way and nothing in this world is a promise but I am exhausted and don't know what else to do. I am seriously considering ending my life, as I don't know what else to do from here. I just wish I had someone who truly cared and would miss me if I were gone because it would make such a difference, but I guess I am one of those forgotten weirdos that weren't going to make it anyway.",BlackCat_8888,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovk2mb/venting/

"Life was going so well, then I crashed","Two months ago, life was great. I was outspoken, and I’m the kind of person you either love or hate… and a lot of people hated me. I didn’t mind though because I had my girlfriend of 8 months, and I had known her for 4 years before dating. I had been depressed before then, but mildly, and I never tried anything. She gave me so much motivation to do everything. Then I fucked up my chance with her, and her family hates me. Parents blocked off all contact with me. Now I have no one to talk to, like at all. It’s been this way for the past month. Waking up hurts, I keep screwing up at work, I can’t feel anything. I tied a noose but I pussied out last night.

I didn't think I would come back here. I just hope someone listens.,"My life has literally, literally gone to hell. My abusers took everything from me and keep doing it even though they're not here anymore. I seriously thought at nineteen I would either be okay or dead. When I was like fourteen I made literal plans to kill myself at eighteen or, a bit later, at twenty. I dreamt about it for years, even after I did try to kill myself at fifteen but ended up regretting it because I didn't want my mum to find my dead body in the morning. I swear I've been trying with everything I have, but my body nor my soul can't take it anymore. I can't sleep in peace. I can't eat without doing it out of anxiety or because I desperately need the dopamine I get out of eating like a fucking pig. I can't make art like before because I just don't feel it. I don't. It feels empty. It's painful. Writing, painting, it's all so painful. My first abuser literally got me into drawing and I can't help but feel like every time I do art he's still with me. I can't even take a shower without feeling so dirty I will scrub my skin raw. I try to drown my emotions, day after day, just a little bit more, and then I break. I'm constantly masking and everyone thinks I'm getting better but I am not. When I was a kid I KNEW I would not have the dream life I wanted. When I turned into a teen, I just knew the probabilities of me killing myself were higher than of me healing, and I was right about everything. 

This is just a rant. Just a rant about how mad and sad I am that life is so difficult, that everything is so wrong, that there are people so evil that would break a child like those men did to me. I promise I've been trying to cope, I've tried everything. I just wish, if there is a God, that He would give me a signal. Why me? What did I do? I can't even keep friendships going now. I had my first love and I ruined it. I can't do it anymore. I can't deal with people. I just can't do this. I want to lie down in the dirt and let the earth take my body back. I don't want to go to therapy anymore. I don't want to need my meds anymore. I just want this to end but I know there is absolutely nothing in this universe that can make that happen. What happened will not un-happen. I won't be saved. 

And I know I don't deserve to be saved either. 

I've been screaming for help since I've had a voice,

no one listens.

May the universe be nice to you all and every future life that comes to this world, but I won't hope for anything anymore. I just don't know what to do. I'm scared.

I think my friend dreamed about my death,"She told me about a dream she had where she was taken out of a history class by one of our teachers and told that I was dead. 

For context, she told me this probably over a year ago. I have never spoken about wanting to die or anything about my mental health. We’re in high school and at the time I remember us talking about how much we hated history and would never choose the subject. So of course everyone thought that dream was bullshit, got a little freaked out then got over it. Fast forward to the present, she has taken history as a subject next year and I have planned my suicide. It seems like I’m watching everything unfold.

Depression is killing me,"Every day I feel like I don’t wanna wake up anymore. I’m tired of crying; nonstop, for days straight. 

I’m so tired of being scared to reach out to people about how I feel. Why? Because they get mad at me for “bringing problems” and being “unstable”. 

Tired of putting on a smile, it’s very draining…

I wish I was dead, either by some accident or something else because I don’t have the courage to take away my life. But sometimes I do feel like taking my life.

I just want the pain to go away, I wanna be happy. I honestly forgot how happiness feels like, I don’t even remember the last time I ever felt happy.

Reasons as to why I feel this way:

1.) For once, I just want somebody to tell me how proud they are of me, I just want somebody to support me and show me how much they love me. My mother and step-father never said ""I’m proud of you” to me. They always congratulate their two other kids and spoil the heck outta them.

2.) My mother is an abusive person: she gaslights a lot, she plays the victim a lot, she’s very manipulative, verbally and emotionally abuses me, she takes away my money and never gives it back, and she never takes responsibility for her actions. 

3.) I was kicked out of home when I was 17 and she didn’t do anything to help me. I had to be moving from home to home in search of a better place to live. I almost got s*xually ass*ulted by some dude in a home I was living in💀

4.) recovering from an abusive relationship. The scars are still here and the trauma won’t go away any time soon.

The people around me; either friends, family, partner, etc., don’t seem to help…

"I feel like I'm too good to be in this world. I'm kind to everyone and I always put others before myself, yet everyone treats me like a rock on the footpath.","I'm too selfless, even to grown ass adults who still behave like kids and throw tantrums. I'm kind to people who abused me, I forgave my physically and emotionally abusive parents. Yet I still continue to be kicked around and abused. Today I was feeding my neighbourhood stray cat and I was thinking about how this homeless cat is in a better mental state than me. She fights for herself without giving a fuck about opinions, she prioritizes herself. She doesn't care if anyone's looking at her or not. She doesn't care if anyone spreads rumors about her. I started weeping, because I help stray cats and dogs even when nobody's looking, which makes me believe that I'm a good person and I deserve to be treated better. This belief breaks me even more when I don't get treated better, instead I'm humiliated and abused every single day. Maybe this is how the world works or maybe I'm too innocent for this world. Even if I die, nobody would care. My parents have told me multiple times already that me killing myself would affect nobody including them. I don't have any friends that don't hurt me with every word that comes out of their mouth. It feels like they look down on me for some reason, it feels like people believe that I'm living the lowest level of lowlife. I've felt this way for 2 years now and I can't take it  anymore. I don't wanna die, but I don't wanna live in a world that breaks my heart every single day. I really wanna find a reason to live but I don't seem to, no matter how much I search for it.

it hurts too much to go on,"im currently a rising sophomore in college, and i had a long term boyfriend during junior and senior year in highschool. in january of this year, we officially broke up because of long distance (i just left to go to a college 600 miles away) but we still had feelings for each other. since then, we have still been talking on and off. i still love him, and up until yesterday, i thought he felt the same. 

when i came home for the summer, we saw each other for two weeks before he left to go on a 1.5 month roadtrip. by the time he got back, id already left to do a summer semester at my college. he rarely had cell service on his trip, so it was hard to talk. one week before he came home, he called me and told me that we should completely break things off this time. he said he needed to focus on school and didnt have time for a relationship, even though he still cared about me. i was heartbroken, but i respected his decision. one thing i did ask tho, was that he should tell me when he stops having feelings for me. this was two weeks ago. 

yesterday, he posts on social media, and a girl i dont know comments that hes cute. i look at her account, and she has posted pictures with him from last week. they were clearly very, very close in the pictures. i was so confused. we had stopped talking a week before these pictures were taken, i couldnt understand how he moved on so fast. 

we have always had a very healthy and honest relationship, so i texted him to try and figure out what was going on. i asked how he moved on so fast, how long he knew this girl, and other questions to try and figure out what was happening. apparently he only started seeing her after he got home from his trip (theyre coworkers) but he does like her, even though he doesnt know if it will lead anywhere. at this point im still so confused so i asked him, why he didnt tell me when he stopped loving me like i wanted him to? and how long ago did he stop loving me?

it was 6 months ago. he said that when he couldnt see me as often as he used to, he lost feelings for me. he had stopped loving me when i left 6 months ago, after loving me for more than 2 years. every single day since i left, i have thought about him every day and i know i still love him. i asked him if he could move on so fast, did he even love me at all. he just told me that he doesnt understand what love is. i am absolutely heart broken. especially because i have screenshots of him texting me that “no amount of time away from you can change the way i feel about you” and “my love for you is forever.” we even talked about marriage and a long term future together. now i realize that its all a lie. 

before we met, i was severely suicidal. i had no friends and no one cared about me. but once i transferred schools i met him, and my life turned completely around. he made me happier than no one ever has. my step mom always praised us for how amazing our relationship was, and always said that we were so lucky to have something like this. she predicted that we would get married. 

i thought i was unlovable, but he was the only person who could love me. i was wrong, as it turns out he cant even say that he did love me anymore. even before he broke things off for good, i started contemplating suicide again. im undecided for my major in college and have no hobbies, talents, or special interests, and i dont think im ever going to find a job that i will like. ive felt like this for years, but my ex boyfriend was the one thing that kept me hopeful. now i just found out he doesnt love me, hasnt loved me for months, and i have no hope left. i was unhappy before he came into my life, and now that hes gone i know nothing is going to get better for me. 

i never attempted to take my life before because i was afraid of the pain, but i dont think anything can feel as bad as this does now. ive already written a suicide note to leave him, and in the next couple of weeks i will probably kill myself. i just wish i would have done it before i met him. 



i created this account just to share this. i doubt its gonna do anything, maybe just one last ditch effort to find some reason why i shouldnt kill myself, but i dont think one exists.",idkwhattodo808,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovjksm/it_hurts_too_much_to_go_on/

**Has attempted suicide in the past.**(Yes I have attempted suicide in the past, but Common Sense loves to put an axe through the attempt by giving me a moral dillema, ""If you commit suicide, while it might be a quick escape for you, you WILL inflict pain on all your friends and family, and as you hate being the source of everyones pain, if you commit suicide you become the source of everyones pain, so two choices, inflict pain on others and commit suicide OR suffer and avoid inflicting pain on others, the choice is yours""

**Has a mental health condition, such as depression and mood disorders, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders.**(While I am not dianosed with other disorders/disabilities other than ADHD and ASD, I DO show mild signs of Bipolar, Schizophrenia, and a few other disorders that can easily be problematic)


Has long-term pain or a disabling or terminal illness.

**Expresses feelings of hopelessness.**(Expresses outwardly, no but inwardly I am certainly always havng a feeling of hopelessness)


**Has money or legal problems.**(YES, This one is to an extremly large extent, no matter how hard I try, no matter what I try to do, money is a GIANT problem, not so much the legal issues though)

Has violent or impulsive behavior.

Has alcohol or other substance abuse problems.

Has easy access to self-harm methods, such as firearms or medications.


Relationship factors

**Has a history of physical, emotional or sexual abuse; or neglect or bullying.**(I was bullied ALOT in school, and to that end was one of the few reasons why I hated school so much.)

**Has lost relationships through break-up, divorce or death.** (Yes but being fair, most of the break-ups were caused by something they did, And I try to pull something to learn from each one, my third and 5th were more my fault, so THOSE ones hurt)

Has a family history of death by suicide.

**Is socially isolated; lacks support.** (ABSOLOUTELY, in this small town town, I practically have no friends, why, because 90% of the population are farmers, and all they care about is farming, and I don't care about farming at all, and I don't want farmer friends)

Community, cultural, societal factors

**Is ashamed to ask for help, especially help for mental health conditions.**( Sort of, I mean, I'm fully capable of reaching out, I think it's more of this underlying fear of being judged)

Lacks access to healthcare services, especially mental health and substance abuse treatment.

Holds cultural or religious belief that suicide is a noble option to resolving a personal dilemma.

Has become aware of an increased number of local suicides or an increase in media coverage of deaths by suicide.",Nathan_Wilson_93,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovfxia/am_i_suicidal_a_retrospective/
I should have died a year ago,"I made up my mind about finally killing myself a year ago from now. But I just never did. I have a few opportunities now. I can just do it. And I’m standing before the decision if I should or not. I can’t shake the feeling that I’m not supposed to be here, that I have nothing to gain and that life is too long.

Yeah, there are good moments, but I hate living so much that the bad outweighs the good. I just think it would be really nice if I was dead.

Venting venting and venting to the only community who understands,"It makes no sense but my negative, suicidal thoughts are safe to me. Like it's a protection. It makes me stay inside where it's safe. It makes me quiet so I don't embarrass myself. It keeps me realistic so I don't get my hopes up to be let down continuously. It doesn't feel good, actually it's quite a killer, but better than living in some fantasy land where I think everything is ok when it's not. I'm over those days. I see much clearer now.

Suicidal thoughts tell me when it's my time. Everyone has a time, but no one wants to live a life full of pain. Suicidal thoughts protect me from the false hope of things getting better, protect me from a life full of pain. The thoughts just seem realistic. They're logical. It's so painful all the same but that's what life is in general right? 

Idk. Knowing that it's an option is how I know that I'm never fully stuck here. It's a shame it's so hard to do but everything in life will be painful, so again it just makes sense that to leave, it'll just be more pain. But it might lead to something much much greater. Some fucking relief

It's 23:18PM in my country now. Tomorrow I'm aiming to drinking myself silly to really go through with my attempt. Hopefully, by early morning 2 days from now I'm gone.

Kill me?,"I live in a state of perpetual self destruction. I drink myself numb every 4 or so days. I wonder how long my heart and liver will last. I'm 22 years old, and have been a raging alcoholic since the age of 17.

I drink in hope of reaching a state of apathy in which I can gather the necessary impulse to off myself. I'm already apathetic towards life and all that it may entail as I've realized years ago that life is but a state of consciousness forced to endure a set of events that prove pointless in the face of our interpretation of logic; namely the concept of uncertainty and the ""fact"" that we know nothing of our ""reality"". I possess the necessary mental faculties to realize that my personal life holds no prospects that would lead my human coil to a feeling of satisfaction and fulfilment. So why bother prolonging this existence of mine, when it's most certainly going to bring upon me nothing but agony?

As for my apathy, I struggle to kill myself due to the fact that my human instincts tell me to stay alive at all cost. It really is such a bother that instincts overpower our logical reasoning, you really have to sacrifice your humanity in order to off yourself; easier said than done.",Neo-unwell,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovd3y3/kill_me/

My best friend got fired from my job today and I'm broken over it.,"Sorry for bad format, on mobile and crying

I (22M) started at my job a little under 2 years ago. My best friend K (20F) started about 3.5 months ago. There's a very high turnover rate here and generally people last about 3-6 months I've noticed. I work at a relatively small bakery and we only ever really have about 14 people employed (baking and sales staff)

For a while I've struggled with depression and would occasionally have mental breakdowns from loneliness and other similar things, but when K started working here we immediately bonded over our love for bad puns. We'd constantly make the same bad jokes and follow them up with finger guns and after a bit I'd be able to go to sleep looking forward to work the next day.

Now I like the owner and he likes me a lot as well, but he would understand us and the baking team would occasionally have to help the sales team when it got busy, K really hated this and would talk about it, and the owner would hear her talking about it. She got a warning last week and got fired today and ever since hearing about it I've been crying, knowing that work will never be the same. Every Sunday and Monday we'd open the bakery and be alone for 2 hours telling stories, listening to music, sharing puns, and having a great time (while working, obviously). Occasionally we'd have these deep conversations about past traumas, family issues, unrequited love, and all that jazz. I can't handle the thought knowing that now I won't be able to look forward to my Sunday and Monday shifts. I'd have more fun at work those days than I do on my days off. I used to think about killing myself quite a bit and since becoming friends with K I haven't thought about suicide at all and now I know that work will never be as good as it was before. I'm sick of training people, becoming acquainted with them and then seeing them leave, and I was not ready to become best friends with someone just to see her go like this. We're still gonna be friends of course and hang out with our free time, but now work is gonna be boring and make me feel numb. I just wanna go back to the way things were.  


Now, after saying this I will mention that I'd never kill myself. K and I have discussed that if either of us were to die it would ruin the other one's life and I could never do that to her.",barwhalis,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ovf6t0/my_best_friend_got_fired_from_my_job_today_and_im/

I don't know what to do anymore,"I just turned 19 and I already want to be gone.

I've been feeling so bad for the last years since middle school, idk how I got so far without going already. I don't feel the motivation to do anything I used to love, I can't listen to music because my head hurts like hell, i stopped eating some days ago, i can't even play games I liked. 

I don't have friends, I've been stressing my bf because idk how to cope with this, I already had three psychologists that were just so bad, i told them specifically to not tell my parents because I know how bad the already think about me, but they told them anyway so I can't find help in those people. 

I feel so lonely and the feeling just keeps on growing everyday, i stopped talking to some ""friends"" because I was always the one to talk first. It's been two days since I told them I'm done with my life and no one has said anything to me. That's just how much they cared about me.

I know it's my fault because I'm always feeling bad, i always feel like I'm just a stubborn that I don't belong no matter where it is. The only friends I thought I had were my bf's friends and not mine. So maybe that's another reason.

I've stopped doing my homework too, I don't care about it anymore. My family doesn't care either, my mom just fucks with my stepdad even when he makes her cry and hurts and yells to my little sister. Just because I'm not his real blood daughter like my little sister he makes my life a living hell. He always tells my mom it's my fault everything that has happened to her. It's always my fault. She never wants to listen to me. She tells she shouldn't had took care of me or throw me to the trash when she could. 

I miss my bf, but he hasn't sent me anything since a couple days. I'm tired of crying everyday even now I can't stop i just cry and cry and no one cares. I feel so lonely here. I thought I could overcome this by going out of my parents house in some years but I can't stand it anymore. I just making my bf mad and angry, just stressing him because idk how to stop feeling like shit. I know it's tiring to deal with me, i know I can't get easily convinced of the contrary to what I say. But I just wanted your love, i just wanted your care, your worries, i just wanted a hug, I wanted to be told that everything would be fine, I wanted to feel happy, I wanted to feel secure, I wanted you to keep insisting that you love me even tho I keep saying that I don't deserve your love, you told me it didn't matter how bad i get everytime I fall in this shit, that you would always be there for me, i thought I had someone, i thought so many things. 

But now i don't anyone again. My grandma, who was more my mother than my mother, is dead. My mom doesn't love me because of that stupid man in the house that's i can't even call a stepdad because he was never my father. My little sister is growing in fear and I can't do anything because she's starting to think like them, selfish, yelling for anything, even hurting me if she doesn't get what she wants, just like them.

I'm so tired of everything, and I don't know what to do anymore. I really wanted to changed, i tried so hard. I just feel like i can't be here anymore, thats why I stopped eating, hopefully I'll die of hunger in a couple days or maybe my sugar levels will increase and I'll die of it. 

I just want it to end. Idek why I'm writing this here. No one will care anyway, I know it's supposed to be to maybe help a little. But man, you and me know we're just strangers on the internet. Why would someone care or be really concerned. Even when I kms no one will cry, no one will miss me, because no one really knew me. Just this rant that I'm writing while crying because I care anymore I'm just so tired and so lonely I just want people to talk to me to tell me not to do it, even when I know I'll still feel the same. i just want it to stop. i don't want to be alone anymore. i feel so scared. i feel like a little child wanting a hug from their mother but not knowing where she is. it hurts more to know that she will never hug me, she hasn't since I was a kid. ijustwanttodie iwanttostopbreathing iwanttostopfeeling ihateithere why did I had to be born this way?????? why can't anything get better

Just another person telling their sad lives," Sometimes reading other people's posts here on Reddit who are having a bad time in life makes me feel less alone. Maybe it isn't the best I can do but I do it, I always come to take refuge in the words of strangers on the Internet who may not even be telling the truth. If someone does this same thing that I do, then here is my post so that you feel accompanied in anguish.

 A few years ago I began to fall into a bottomless maze. Everything from bad to worse, everything in pieces. I attended psychologists and psychiatrists but none of them managed to fully help me. The medication kept me stable for almost two years so I didn't feel the need to unalive myself. On the other hand, psychologists recommended things like *meditation* and *deep breaths* that didn't help me at all. Maybe the trauma is not solved that way, ~~maybe it is never solved~~. (And yes, I have a virtual library full of workbooks for social anxiety, depression, an eating disorder, a personality disorder, and PTSD, but things are still complicated).

 Today I'm in what many call the ""best years of life"" (almost 22) and I must admit that I have not really enjoyed or been happy since I was 10 or so. I don't have a college degree or a job. Until last year I had 6 friends and today I have none left, I was distancing myself from everyone because of the damage that I supposed I was doing to them. I don't have a partner nor do I get along with my family. Anyways, I'm mired in loneliness and uselessness.

 Knowing all this, I can assume that rather than being in the ""best years"" I'm in *the years of greatest sadness and detachment from reality*. I have a plan in case things get worse because things can always get worse, even when you think you are completely lost. I have the letters ready to be sent and also other things. 

 While the day-to-day feels like nonsense, I wish I could progress. I wish that if you got here reading you can also achieve the best for your life. There are many people who say that things get better. Is it a matter of believing their words?",berenjenaconmostaza,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ov2mz5/just_another_person_telling_their_sad_lives/

At first, she showed up regularly and was very kind to me, but after a while, she has turned into my worst nightmare. Perhaps i said something wrong? I don't know. She scares me a lot. Now she almost never shows up and my hallucinations have almost stopped entirely without any meds or something like that. But i know she still watches me, and i hope she comes back one day.

"Life feels pointless, job sucks, why bother.","I genuinely don't know what the fuck I'm doing here. I wake up every day and do the same stupid shit, play the same boring ass video games, watch the same stupid youtube channels, 5 of those days I work my shitty job that hasn't given me a raise in an entire year and only pays a measly $12/hour, then food and gym and sleep. Repeat forever apparently.

I hate my job, I hate my entire life. The job allows me to work remote so I stay in bed all day and this helps cut some costs (gas, dumb 'convenience' foods for lunch, car wear and tear) and saves me  from having to wake up an hour early to get ready and commute but the pay is dog shit and the area I live in is nice but the only other job options seem to be similarly dog shit paying ones. I live out near a college, and the only jobs here are basically retail to give the fucking stupid college kids something to do. 

I want to be a personal trainer and I know I can do that because I've been the go-to free trainer for all of my friends and girlfriends. I look like I'm on steroids according to everyone that compliments my physique, I have won powerlifting competitions and am almost to the point where I can take some records. I know everything about nutritional science, biomechanics, anatomy, exercise science, basically I digested every single bit of information over the past 12 years that relates in any way to what I do and what I would need to know to train people. I did it all to make myself better at this shit, but thanks to all of that research I can absolutely say I can do the job I want to do. I am the go-to guy in my gym when I'm there for random questions/advice, everyone seems to want to ask me for help on this or that movement or whatever muscle group they're trying to build more or ask me if I know why X body part is hurting in XYZ way. The gym related parts of my life do not depress me; This is literally the only thing I enjoy, hence I would like to turn it into a career path and finally have a job that MATTERS. I am so sick of working jobs that do not fucking matter. If I suddenly stop showing up, nothing changes at all. I am tired of being expendable and useless to some stupid company.

Anyway this unfortunately requires degrees or licenses because clearly you can't just look at me and know that I know what the fuck I'm talking about/what I'm doing, and those cost MONEY. Oh lord, the most important and only thing in all of life: Money! Moneyyyyy! Gotta have money! The fucking idiots that have it can go get their licenses and then do the job I want to be doing but with a fraction of the knowledge and no general fucking clue what they're doing. I see so many fucking people who are licensed to do the job I want to do, the job I could do way fucking better than they can, that don't know their god damn head from their ass hole. But no, they got the fancy piece of paper that says they're allowed to do it so they're allowed to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

All my friends tell me ""Oh just save up money! Just save the money and get the license!"" Okay, how? On my shit-tier pay, with all my bills to pay which basically eats up every single cent I get each month. How the fuck am I gonna save? Then they tell me, ""Oh just move back to the city and get a job here plenty of jobs here"" Okay, how? How do I just go about violating my apartment lease to move to a new apartment? Who's gonna pay all the move-in costs for me? Who's gonna pay for the rest of the lease that I'm breaking? Or they say ""Oh just get another job out there then!"" Okay, let me just gamble by leaving the current job and hope that the one I end up in doesn't tank or isn't something I can handle on a daily basis. Sure, let me just risk being completely broke and homeless on a whim with no safety net or savings.

My friends all are the types that got massively fucking lucky somehow and got nice jobs so they could get houses before turning 25 already but they just fucking stumbled their way into those jobs. It's like their life path was determined and no matter what they would've ended up well-off at this point no matter what the fuck they did. None of them are any sort of above-average in any way yet they landed jobs that are far above average in pay and wouldn't ya know it, they're also easy jobs and they \*LOVE\* their jobs SO MUCH!!

I'm fucking sick and tired of this shit! I am far smarter than any of them and I could very easily do all of their fucking jobs better than they can but noooooo I don't get those opportunities. So now they get to sit their in their houses and tell me to do this or that as if they actually fucking have a clue why they got to where they are. Their advice is terrible, it's bullshit and after I rip it apart logically they all get pissy because I'm 'just being negative and defeatist'. If the advice/suggestions are so easy to pick apart, maybe it's because they fucking suck and won't work in reality! Not all of us had our parents help us so much then somehow magically landed some incredible paying job. 

And I'm fucking sick of all the god damn activities I used to enjoy. I used to like gaming, now it is so fucking incredibly boring I can barely stomach anything for more than 20 minutes. I used to enjoy watching anime and movies but I sat and ran through everything good on marathon for a few years and now there's nothing to watch. One or two good movies come out a year, and no good anime has come out in fucking forever. But really all these did was keep me complacent and entertained enough to not think about reality.

In reality, I am 30 years old making shitty fucking pay at a shitty fucking job and because of the cost of all my bills and groceries I am unable to save anything because I barely break even every month. I have an incredibly brilliant mind overall, and in regards to the one thing I actually want to do for a career I would excel at it without issue. I have built a body that other men dream they could, I have moved weights and performed athletic feats that are impossible for 99.9999999% of the population which one would assume should work in my favor for my chosen career path but I am stuck unable to do what I want because I don't have some tiny piece of fucking paper that 'allows' me to do the job and being intelligent only makes me able to realize how incredibly stupid and unfair this whole life has been.

I envy the stupid people of the world because they don't have the ability to think about the world and realize how pointless and unfair it all is.

At this moment, the only ones affected by my discontinued existence would be my cats and I'm sure someone would be more than happy to take them anyway. I have nothing to live for, I provide nothing to the world, if I didn't exist tomorrow nothing would change. I don't want to just keep living paycheck to paycheck, just surviving, for another 60-70 years. I just do not see a point to carrying on when I'm not going to achieve the life I want. Self-help shit, motivational shit, none of it works on me because my brain rips the words to pieces and none of it applies to me. I don't expect any useful information or advice from this, I just needed to vent this all out anonymously because if I send it to people who know my address they'll call the police and an ambulance to come visit me and check on me and I don't want that shit because they're not going to help fix the problems in my life they're just going to try and force me to stay alive unhappily. I do not want to be here anymore. Anyone who tries to tell you that life has some purpose or meaning or point is fucking lying. Either you pulled the right number out of the hat when you were born and will have everything given to you or you'll just be stuck existing and watching everyone else be happy but never be happy yourself.

If I dont kill myself no one is going to.,"I made this account almost a year ago, since then I have been here reading posts daily.

In the past year, I have failed suicide twice and stopped before attempting 4 times.

I have been fighting depression for 5 years now, and suicidal thoughts for even longer. 

Nothing is changing for the better it's just getting worse, the longer I live, the more reasons I find to hate myself and life, I'm so deep in this shit that it is actually too late.

I'm just living day after day, losing myself more and not achieving anything.

I'm in a loop, I'm living the same day for 5 years and it's hurting me knowing it.

No ups my life was only going straight or down.

Nothing on this world opened my eyes more than death, nothing brings me joy, and I'm not really interested in anything that's worth living for.

I sadly disappointed myself with this life, but I don't want more suffering and torturing for absolutely no reason.

The title really made me think, more than always, and it's true I'm not just going to die out of nowhere.

I've had multiple deaths in my family over the past 2 years, I had to quit university because my mental health was getting way too bad, I don't have a job and can't seem to get one, I feel like the few friends I have are slowly but unstoppably drifting away from me, I don't know how to make new ones, I can't afford to go to the gym or a museum or a club or anything where I could meet people, I have no one to talk to when I'm feeling at my lowest, I had the biggest fight to date with my motger today because she outright refused to talk to me when I told her something she did upset me, I just numb and distract myself with videogames, sleep and the internet, because as soon as I get torn back into the real world everything crashes on me and all I can do is cry and I can feel suicidal thoughts to start creeping into my mind but I can't even look for help with that.

"Well it finally happened, I cried from loneliness","Well, it finally happened. In 2011 I met a girl and we dated for 7 years. Throughout the relationship she said she couldn't have kids. I wanted kids but I stayed with her and said it's ok if we can't. After 7 years she cheated on me and got pregnant to another guy. I was depressed for 3 years straight.

Then in 2020, I met a woman on a paid-for dating site. I assumed it would help me to find someone serious. Well, it turned out after several months of getting to know her and bond with her 2 children that she was a prostitute (a real prostitute) and had been sleeping with men behind my back.

We had some furious arguments and in a drunken argument (her drunk), she said ""you mean less to me than air"".

When she said this. I lost it. I was so so so so hurt. She ended up blocking me on everything. I sent a whole bunch of emails asking if we can talk. Long story short, she stopped emailing me back and left me blocked. Today I found out she's been dating other guys.

I live alone. And I work from home. I'm at home practically 24/7. This evening I just broken down. A 31 year old male, just broken down crying. I'm currently laying on my bed with the fan on drying my tears. I've had too much pain. Too much heartbreak. I can't take it anymore.

the concept of working a 9-5 fills me with so much dread,"can anybody relate to this? i graduated college (miraculously) but finding a job related to my major has been a bust, so i’ve been working a basic boring retail job to support myself.

while it pays the bills and my coworkers are alright, the idea of working 8+ hours a day 5 days a week (which is often more than that) fills me with so much dread and sadness that i just feel so empty. i fucking hate it. 

i didn’t expect nor even really want to make it this long, but now i’m expected to work and do everything myself, and for what? i don’t have anything to look forward to and i have my doubts about actually getting a job in something i have more passion or interest in, which is my fault for majoring in something worthless anyway. but still. i was told to go into something i enjoyed so i did, but all it did was leave me with a huge bill. 

even though i don’t have many hobbies, i want to still be able to do them. if i want to play video games all day why can’t i? does that make me worthless or a failure to society if i do something that makes me happy? what about painting? or reading? or just fucking sitting there watching the clock tick on by. 

why can’t i use my time the way i want? i stayed alive this long because it “gets better”, but i feel just as stuck as i once did. 

i don’t know how to deal with these feelings of dread. i work tomorrow and it’s ruining my day off today. i don’t want to do this anymore. i’m tired of this dread and hopelessness and i don’t want to have to deal with it every single day just so i can have a roof over my head and food in the fridge.

List of things that make me depressed (It adds up and makes me wanna kill myself),"* A soon to be 20 year old virgin
* Never had a girlfriend or 1st kiss
* No Friends outside of some people on social media
* Never went to prom and didn't go to graduation because I don't have friends anyways
* Not close to my family
* Multiple disorders, Such as Social Anxiety Disorder
* Too skinny and weak
* Don't have talent
* I don't get to go out much
* My social anxiety prevents me from doing everything work, school, making friends, having a good relationship with family
* Self-Conscious, I don't like my voice or appearance
* My parents hate each other, They've been yelling and arguing since I was a baby
* Seeing everyone party and drink, hanging out with friends, enjoying life, having sex, having a good job they enjoy, being able to socialize and be loved and me not being able to have that makes me wanna kill myself
* I barely get anything to eat because my parents don't like to cook 
* I stay in my room because I don't like being around my dad
* I'm super awkward and shy
* I've been bullied and now Im just fucked in the head
* I get a bunch of anxiety, Im paranoid

The only things that keep all this out my mind is playing games, watching youtube, marvel movies, tv series, masturbating, sexting with girls just as desperate as I am. Surprised women even want to sext with me.

That is one thing that gives me hope. Maybe I'm not as ugly and pathetic as I think I am if a girl actually wants to do something like that with me.

I've only ever had online sexual relationships. Nothing even close in person. Masturbating so much makes crave sex but it definitely helps with my anxiety. I don't know if I'll ever be ready for life or a real relationship at this rate.

&amp;#x200B;

I always feel like when I finally find real love in person with a girl who loves me that my life would be so much better just having someone there for me if all goes well.

I would make sure not to hurt her in any way. It feels like finding love would rid me of most of my problems.

I really wanna better myself to be a man worthy of love but at the same time it's hard to find the motivation when I don't have anyone there for me aside from my parents who hate each other. My father used to be kinda abusive but he stopped completely but he still yells at the top of his lungs when upset. 

Anyways how do people find love outside of social media. Is it at work? Do they just ask a random stranger? Does it just happen from constantly talking to people? 

A girlfriend would really help me. I know you can't just find love that easy though. She would also have to have similar sexual desires as me and when I say this I just mean wanting sex at least once a week. 

Maybe that's selfish but I wouldn't rush it I would allow up to a year of no sex but any more than that is just not what I'm looking for in a relationship.

I don't really see a point in living anymore,"I can't say that this is the most suicidal I've ever been but I can say that I'm more capable of doing something to myself now. I used a suicide chat today for the first time ever and they weren't very helpful. What's worse is that I had to use it while my family wasn't home bc I know that that's the only time I wouldn't be interrupted or barged in on.

Basically I've been feeling like no one will ever want me or love me and I'm just gonna be unloved for the rest of my life. I don't just mean it romantically, although it seems like no one wants me in that way either. Everyone uses me for sex or as some kind of guinea pig before actually getting into a relationship with someone else. And it's become a pattern where I'll find out someone I was ""talking to"" and really cared about, was way more into someone else and was leading me on.

But I mean it in a platonic sense too. All my friends are closer with other people and would probably consider me more as an acquaintance now. My closest friend doesn't talk to me anymore, it's like she forgot about me. I feel like everyone is able to make close and long lasting connections with other people but for some reason, I can't. Everyone eventually moves on and forgets about me. And then I feel like I'm delusional for thinking we were close. 

My family constantly body shames me and makes me feel guilty whenever I eat food. I don't feel safe in my home anymore and I desperately want to move out. But because I recently loaned them a large portion of my savings, I won't be able to for another few years. I just can't wait any longer. But they're making me feel guilty for even thinking about moving out.

I just feel stuck. I feel like I'm never gonna experience love and being loved. I feel like no one cares about me. I wish I could just leave my home and everyone could forget about me.

"My dad just threw both of my cats away, and I couldn't get more affected by that.","This is literally super weird, and idk why did my dad involve the cats.
My sister and I were arguing about why my method of cleaning the poop was wrong or right. And my dad just comes in and screams that the cats gotta be thrown away ND throws them away ""because we can't take care of them"" when my sister and I were clearly discussing about that. 

I consider animals equal to ourselves after looking at things more spiritually, like animals having no sense of judgement... and people using their reason of judgment to do evil, all that sort of thing. I've always seen the innocence of animals the thing that makes them equal to humans having the capacity to reason and think of abstract concepts of good and evil and the likes of empathy. (Not vegan btw, I still consume animal products) 

With that said, I'm more shocked at how ignorant my dad is (that I'm gonna be stuck with for three more years) putting animals in potential pain because some trivial argument about how poop should be cleaned. 

I wonder if back in older times it was usual to put animals in suffering to punish siblings arguing about trivial stuff.

He could have perfectly scolded both of us, banned me and my sister of WiFi... these are material things, they don't really suffer. Idk why would my dad think that it would be a good punishment for us to throw the cats to the street to punish us siblings for arguing about poop (which the poop didn't bother him at all). 

I was about to cut myself until my mom found me pressing the knife against my arm, I was ready to bleed out (hopefully) just to make some miserable old man wake up from ignorance.

It reminds me of that time where ppl blamed videogames for school shootings. Completely unrelated reasons for a kid to decide shoot a school.
And some hard headed people still think the same because they can't handle the facts... it saddens me that ignorance is selective.

Ignorance is, in my opinion, the worst human disease, because some people can really choose to have it.
And it hurts that humans choose to put other lifeforms in pain because of that.

Right now I'm in my aunt's house (who somehow ""understands"" the actions of my dad) with one of the cats that I managed to find (because the other one goes searching for mates and all) and we are pretty chill here. The cat is very attached to me, my sister and mom because we pretty much raised them.

I don't like when people take someone's child away, that just sucks.
So many knifes and one cut is, what I think, all I need to wake some people up.

It's 5 AM now, I've been crying for the past 7 hours sensing the heartbeat of my cat in my hands. There are things worse than death, and I feel like I can ensure my cat's good life if I die. After all there are worse things than death.
If i stop suffering then my cats will hopefully stop suffering too.

After all I'm doing this all for myself, right? Because my moral judgment will not let my mind suffer from not obeying it... The foundation of empathy and reason imprinted in my brain. What makes me human that is. 

Killing my dad? Never. 

I can't kill people, there are other people who care for people. 
I couldn't bear knowing that someone is suffering because I took someone's life. 

Hey I'm just 18, people have known me for... 18 years, people have known my dad for more than 50 years. 

People would certainly forget about me easily. 

This ""fleeting sadness"" isn't depression, I know. 
But it's so recurrent and reappearing in my life that I might as well make myself not conscious anymore. 

I've always been a loyal believer of Christianity and it's philosophy. 
But man, if I have to go to hell for the greater good, I will do it. 

(Heck, that even sounds like a Doom line)

i don’t know who i can tell this,"i really can’t afford to live where i am anymore. let’s just go over 2021 shall we? 
Haven’t paid my car registration because my car needed work done on it and i wanted that fixed first so now my car has been towed. The registration is now 1500$ plus insurance. I live in LA and work 15 miles away from home but if i ever miss the train I have to take an uber, which is about 30-50$ one way. So now I’m spending more on gas to be late to my job awesome. My cars been in impound 16 days I can’t even look at the fees because they only go up. I haven’t paid my car payment this month because I didn’t have enough money to pay my rent. And even to pay my rent I had to ask my ex boyfriend for money. Trying to be an honest person when I got paid the next week I sent him back 1/2 of what he gave me. Some how I survived two weeks to get another paycheck but I forgot my hours were cut due to lack of work so my check won’t cover my rent this month either. So wait just get another job right! Well i did but I won’t be getting my first check until two weeks from now, a week after my rent/car payment and the day my car will be owned by the impound lot. The final straw this week was coming home to a letter that says my rent hasn’t been paid for over 10 months. Which is isn’t totally impossible because I’m subletting from a man who I pay my rent to in money orders . Easily track able but my name isn’t on the lease technically for the building. On top of that I haven’t talked to my father in over a week because the last text message I got from him was saying our phone bill was over $1000 and my anxiety about the rest of that text made me avoid opening it.

I don't want to feel like this any longer. I've already fucked over my future. I'm only 16, so why did this life have to put me in these circumstances? It's not fair.
None of my family gives a shit about me. I don't remember ever having a meaningful talk with them. They do the bare minimum. They don't care about mental health or shit like that. I could never talk to them.
Also, they're all extremely transphobic. I'm a trans guy (FTM) and it just makes every day even more of a pain, having to pretend to be someone I'm not. They don't even allow me to cut my hair short, dammit. It drives me insane. My life would be a thousand times easier and better if I could've just been born a man. 
I have genuinely no friends. I was an asshole to my friends at school, just because it made life a little more interesting. All I do every day is waste my time, scrolling through my phone. I never even go outside anymore.
I genuinely do not see a point in living this life anymore. I could go on for ages about why there's no point to it but it doesn't matter. I have nothing to live for.

I've messed up again. This started because we were cuddling and the didn't make a move on my wife. She then felt unwanted and unattractive and said that to me.

I tried to make it up to her by starting a massage and apologising for not making a move first. She began to question me on why I didn't and when I felt overwhelmed because I felt I couldn't answer I raised my voice and said ""Stop. Can't you just..."" Before stopping.

She got exceptionally scared and said that I need to get out. That she needed to sleep alone tonight and that I would need to sleep on the couch.

I apologised for raising my voice and she didn't answer. I told her that I was getting a panic attack starting because of what was happening and she didn't answer. I understand that she wouldn't answer because what I was saying wasn't helpful to the situation and she's right that it wasn't.

I had to leave the room multiple times, because I was frustrating and upsetting her each time that I wasn't apologising properly for scaring her, and because I wasn't showing any sympathy for how she felt and that she was scared.
During one of those leaves I self-harmed. Both with striking myself and strangulation. Before returning and trying again.

Life keeps getting worse and worse and worse and I need help,"I’ve never posted on this subreddit. Very briefly viewed it in the past. Never thought I’d hit this point but here I am.

2 months ago I was extremely content and hopeful about my life. I had just quit my 9-6:30+ to pursue freelance work full time and make my own schedule. Just moved into a really nice house. Hosted a birthday party with 30+ friends in attendance. Things were great until my actual birthday came around the next week, then everything fell apart. 

I had contacted a close friend about why they weren’t in attendance at my birthday and why I hadn’t heard from them at all. Wasn’t aggressive, just worried about my friend is all. They blocked my number and my social media without responding after I reached out.

Long story short, this person had begun to communicate with my 3 closest friends telling them I had done something harmful to them and that they need to drop communicating with me for a period of time.

One month later (after being in the dark and shunned by others) I learned that this person had been spreading a lie about me stating that I had sexually violated them when in reality I did not. All of my friends believed them because they were the “victim” in this scenario. I can’t blame them. Just wish they would believe me instead. 

Since then I have lost virtually everything while trying to defend myself. I was kicked out of my house, fired from my jobs, lost my business partner, my friends, and the will to live. 

I live in a shithole apartment for way more money than I can afford in the most devastating housing crisis my city’s history. 
I have no income, no friends, no prospects, no fallback, and things keep piling up.

Every day seems like a new fresh hell. I don’t want to keep going. I’m way too tired and fucked up from the trauma and the gaslighting to even consider continuing to push.",orchidnecktattoo,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ov0ode/life_keeps_getting_worse_and_worse_and_worse_and/

They keep making bullshit promises, oh yeah we will get you a care coordinator and get a meeting in place.
I check again. They didn’t even bother to write it down.. 

They clearly don’t give a single fuck about my life.
I don’t either.

My arm is burning, I went to the sink and starting cutting horizontally which I’ve always been able to avoid in my years of self harm. But now I’ve started. It’s not deep enough for any concern.
I’m afraid next time I pick it up, I won’t be able to stop.

I could feel myself starting to dissociate and switch to that mindset of numbness and one goal in mind.
Cut. Die. 

It’s what has lead me to be hospitalised many times since the age of 15. I’m nearly 20 now.

Prior to going to the sink today, i was trying to force myself to throw up. I’ve always had those thoughts when I get too full. But now they are turning to action.

I think the most reason I’m reaching out is because if my parent gets home, I don’t want to scar them. 
I couldn’t care less about myself,
It’s just how it’ll affect others around me.

My mum said before she left to ring her or go out the house to where she is if I need help.
But I don’t think I have enough strength to.. I’ve only barely been able to pick up the phone lately.

I know I need help but I’m scared.. I desperately don’t need the trauma of hospital again, and it would be incredibly selfish of me considering COVID. 

I don’t know what to do.. I have some online friends that I started to try and reach out to, but I stopped myself because they have enough going on.

An impossibly easy choice,"I have four options: 1. Keep doing bee relocations for this reality show that's about to start filming. 2. Quit and go back to college. 3. Live with my parents until they die and live off their wills. 4. Kill myself.     
1. Bee work is hard, hot, gross, and painful. I'm only doing it because there's supposed to be a musical element, but listening in on the main character's phone calls, the production company is fighting over the right to control the show's music. Even if he gets to do it, there's a lot of people who are gonna be in this ""band"", so you have to insert yourself into every song you can. Never having been in a band, I don't know how to walk the line between bossy/aggressive and too passive. Everyone else I know of involved in this aspect of the show has experience in bands and knows better how to walk this line, not to mention a lot of them know each other and I don't know any of them (though I've met a few briefly). You can't do the music stuff without doing the bee stuff (which I really suck at, even for a beginner). Even if I do stick it out they might not choose me to be on the show, and if they do I might be the idiot character (reality tv can twist ""reality"" however they want, and I do a lot of idiotic stuff on the jobs gauging by the others' reactions).     
2. I didn't have to do any work to move onto the next grade level until 8th grade, so in a way that way my first real year of school. Not surprisingly, I really suck at the whole school thing (it took me five years to graduate highschool, and that was with an unbelievable amount of slack cut for me). Mental illness gets in the way a lot, and even if I do manage to get a degree I'm worried I'll just get a job I hate and work until either I die or I'm too old to do anything anyway. Going straight to working leads to this problem as well. I don't know that there's anything I can do almost everyday for that long without growing to hate it.   
3. I'm already 23 and basically living with my parents (unless I keep doing the bee stuff, I've been living in the place they operate from for less than 2 weeks). I've already become more of a loser every year that passes since I graduated highschool, and I don't want to continue becoming more and more of a loser until I'm 30 living with my aging parents (my parents are in their early 60's, so they probably have less than two decades to go).       
4. I don't really see too many disadvantages from killing myself aside from making some people sad. I acknowledge that that is a big disadvantage of that path, but would the sadness they feel at my passing over their lives equal that which I would experience over my life if I were to live? In the short term definitely, but life is a long term situation. I also want to kill myself for many reasons that aren't related to it being a seemingly sensible path for me to take, but I'm not even going to go into those.",bloodraged189,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ov2203/an_impossibly_easy_choice/
"""help is available, we care for you""","Alright, I'll get straight to the point. My suicidal posts (not necessarily on this account even though I post about my suicidality here sometimes as well) get no attention or care whatsoever. In fact, not mine alone, yours too.

I don't deserve their love and I shouldn't have given them the chance. 

I'm not going to kill myself. But I wish I had. It is my worst regret when I look at where I am and where my mental health continually ends up. I am just exhausted, tired of all roads leading back here.

Boyfriend doesn't understand my mental health.,"This is my first time posting on this sub, I was afraid that a friend or family member would somehow find this so I made a second account. I know it sounds silly, but everyone I know has a Reddit account. 


I've struggled with anxiety and depression for a long time, unfortunately I'm too nervous to get help. My family doesn't know that I have depression, I just told them that I have anxiety. My boyfriend knows everything though, he's usually pretty understanding about it but he can also be rude.. I never tell him when I have panic attacks because I don't want to be a burden. I know that's a big no no but unfortunately that's how I am. He doesn't fully understand how I feel, I always try to talk to him about it but even then I can tell he gets annoyed. Today I had a mental breakdown while my boyfriend and sister were in the car with me, but I kept It together. I silently cried and held my mouth shut so that they wouldn't be able to tell, don't worry I wasn't the one driving! We had a fight before this happened by  the way, when we got home he said he was sorry for how he acted. Unfortunately we were with my sister so I couldn't say anything, I tried to force some words out but I knew that I would end up crying or breaking down. He assumed that I was mad at him, when we were finally alone I apologized and told him that I couldn't say anything because I was having a panic attack. And I couldn't force myself to say anything, he sighed and just said ""whatever, you never tell me what's going on anyways."" And just left the room, I might be over thinking this (as usual) but he didn't even seem worried.  Sometimes I wish I could just die in my sleep so that I wouldn't have to worry about being a burden to anyone, I told my boyfriend that he can leave me anytime because I know I can be a lot to deal with. It's not his fault, I know I should get help and deal with this on my own but it's just so hard.. I'm sorry for making this a long post, but unfortunately I don't have anyone to talk to about this. Thank you to everyone who took the time to read my rant, I hope it gets better for everyone soon.",Present-Mix7563,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ouyirq/boyfriend_doesnt_understand_my_mental_health/

It’s just hard to see life as worth living after losing all I held dear. It holds self-evident that the people I loved all seem so much better off without me.

Complaints aside, I love you all so much; that’s why I don’t want to stay and burden you all anymore. I’ve nothing more to give to this world, save for bitterness and grievance. I promise this is no fault of your own, I planned on this happening someday anyway. Matter of fact, I likely would have done this long ago had you not given me something to look forward to in life.

I’m such a coward,"Yesterday, I wrapped a phone charger around my neck. I’m a coward, though, so I couldn’t physically get it tighter than uncomfortable. Even then, after a little while, I wanted to take it off. I could feel my pulse through the cord and I wanted to cry. What a p*ssy-ass-bitch. I didn’t take it off, though, and instead called the suicide hotline where I was put on hold for a long time. Then, my (ex?)partner walked into the room, looked at me like the pathetic piece of trash I am, removed the chord, and pulled me into the living room for “supervision” while they played video games. Time went by way too fast. My (ex?)partner told me to go to bed, but not without also commenting that they hadn’t eaten anything. I hadn’t cooked dinner, you see, so they went without food.

Why am I such a coward?? Why couldn’t I do it? Why do I have to continuously live like this??? I want to get better but it feels impossible. I feel trapped and I want to feel free. I want my own space away from people so I can work through my sh*t without also having to accommodate other people. I’m only a danger to myself because I’m so desperate to make the people around me happy but always fail. If I was alone I would only have to make myself happy and only be around others when I feel healthy enough to be around them. Is that weird backwards logic? God I wanna kill myself so badly.

To top it off I have no social skills and I think this is the most insecure I've ever been. I'm not at peak health, making me look unattractive, which is extremely important at this age. I'm too depressed to do basic things like brush my teeth and work out consistently. It's never consistent. 

My grades are the lowest they've ever been. I've had decent grades but keeping them up put me through so much mental and emotional agony. 

I'm so lonely. I can't see myself in any career because I have zero energy and motivation to actually attain one. I just...I'm so angry. Angry that I have to put my blood, sweat, and tears into making a life for myself when I get nothing out of it. Just surviving to suffer.  It's been like this for years. I've been so lonely and isolated that I actually feel insane. 

No man will ever look at me with desire or love. Not the real me. I'm not one of those chicks going through PMS or BDD. I actually am unattractive. I hate that I feel like I have to have a partner or be attractive to be happy. To enjoy living. But it's true. I'm a fat, and pimply with an overbite. It's not helping that I'm a POC surrounded by white people who prefer other white people. I'm desperate and insecure and have no self-esteem. Who tf wants a girl like that?? No one! No one wants me. No one will ever look at me with desire or lust/love.

 I can't give up on picturing the life I want to have. I just want it so badly. And if I can't have it I just don't wanna live anymore. Idc if I sound silly or selfish. I'm getting nowhere in life and life is so painfully boring when I'm not crying in self pity. I'm stuck. I've been stuck for so long. Stagnant. There is no meaning or purpose in my life. I feel so insignificant, like a grain of sand in a desert. I don't wanna get up to work for it either. I'm angry that I've been putting my back out for this long and nothing has happened. Nothing has gotten better. Now I just want everything to come to me. But it won't. 

I'm so tired. I wanna nice long sleep. I just want a break from it all. Where no one can judge me or look at me. A nice relaxing, nourishing sleep where I don't have to lift a finger. Where I don't have to overthink or feel anything anymore. Where my worries and anxiety will just disappear. One that won't ever end. I think I've earned a good life...so why is mine still so shitty? I don't wanna try anymore. I'm angry and I'm done.",p34chbunni,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ov1oc8/being_an_ugly_poor_teenage_girl/
My career is making me suicidal,"First off, I am NOT a cop. I am a 24 year old male, that works as a Detention Officer for our local sheriffs office. I have been in my detention facility for a little over two years now. At first, I loved my job. I thought it was the most badass thing. Being there made me feel like a god in terms of controlling someone's life. I lived by the moto of ""No guns, just guts"". I felt amazing. After some time of dealing with these inmates, I started to relate to the bunch of them. The high majority of them are just normal, 9-5 guys/gals that messed up and wound up here. I felt bad for the lot of them even though they made their own decision's. After a year here, I had seen a lot of things that have been messing with me. I would lay down and hear things in the middle of the night that would remind me of certain things that had happened. I have been going on some severe depression, caffeine, and nicotine. I have been trying to move on with a different career but has been a challenge with money and some other personal deals. I have been scared for what I'm becoming and what I might do. I hit a new level of depression. I am scared because I came up with a plan on how I'm going to end everything. I told my shift supervisors about all of this and they told me that they would contact a doctor... It's been 4 days since then and still haven't heard anything. Does anyone have any ideas?

I could end it right now.,"This is a bit of a brain dump so please don't immediately worry. However if anyone has any vapid words of encouragement I'd appreciate it.

So like - from a while ago i have a huge stash of Bisoprolol (short version: they thought I had a heart problem but didn't and I have meds left over). This medication slows the heartrate, essentially. If enough is taken it will stop the heart.

Basically if taken in a suicidal sense it's one of the few meds that WILL work cos it'll knock you out before you're sick.

I don't want to die. But I'm having a bad day/week/etc and I'm just over it all. My country doesn't have easy-to-access or even good inpatient mental health care and idk. I'm in UK.

idk whether to just call someone acting like I will top myself or actually try it in order to get help. They don't actually assist otherwise, they put you on an 18 month waiting list.

i'm always so angry,"Sometimes I think my old therapist was wrong about my diagnosis. Then I get the feelings &amp; thoughts I do like today. I guess I got used to my own terrifying thoughts, or maybe I just convinced myself they weren't real. It's so bad people can see through it, I'm honestly terrible about hiding my emotions. I think trying to kill myself gave me brain damage, or maybe how I got this scar on my forehead caused it. My delusions even if they change into something else always manifest into something equally as big as the delusion before. It's possible I'm just realizing today after all my failures that I am not savable. If only I could tell anyone how deeply I am lost. Was everyone right about me being crazy? Well, yes. Anyone could see it, it's just I really couldn't for so long. That's how I kept getting more lost. 

Every time I get closer to people the pain that comes when leaving them hurts more each time. It's like I hope more every time &amp; each time the distance greatens.

To Heidi,"I posted this on r/unsent letters, but I was told I'd get better support on this sub. I'm sorry if this is a bit messy, I just really need a place to vent. I'm fucking traumatized. I genuinely just want to end my life because I'll never be able to erase this from my memory. I just want to be with my sister again. I'd appreciate if anyone here could listen to my story. I keep getting bullied for being so angry, but I feel like I have a damn good reason to.

*If you thought this would be a letter thanking you for ""giving my sister a good send off,"" you couldn't be more wrong.*

*Let me make one thing clear: just because you sang to my sister and treated her with respect before you put her in the oven doesn't make me hate you less. Just because you're a family friend that also happens to be a grief therapist, or because you wanted to genuinely help and do something kind or because you gave me tacky memorial gifts or offered to pay for her utn doesn't make me hate you less. Every ounce of your being disgusts me.*

*What did you think you were accomplishing by incinerating my nine year old sister? My mother told you we wanted to bury her if we could have afforded it, beside her dad who died last year. Did you think you were doing something dignified when you crushed her skull with a rake? How about when you put her tiny brittle bones into a blender to pulverise them? Or to top it all off, when you accidentally got a hole in the plastic bag with her ashes in it, causing some to fall out, and your solution, your way if ""helping"" was to sweep them up with a dustpan and brush. That's ingrained into my memory. That will never go away. That traumatized me. My lovely sister doesn't even have a body anymore. You just swept her up like a pile of rubbish.*

*You disgust me. It's been nearly two months since the fucking cancer got her and everyday I hate you more. How do you justify incinerating kids? You don't. I don't care if you were heartbroken and apparently cried while you burnt her. You deserve to have that pain. It was so hard to refrain from hitting you and digging my thumb's into your eyes when you swept her up like that. And don't get me started with those tacky memorial gifts, like a ceramic ornament with puppies and some corny quite about heaven. My sister liked cats. And stop saying she's in heaven and with God when you know my mother and I have religious trauma and are atheists. Every time you try to help you make things worse. I wish you'd just die.*

*I hope you know the only reason I haven't knocked you out is because you're a therapist, and my mother has PTSD from the Iraq war. I love her, and I wish she could get better fucking help than you, but since you know her personally and don't cost anything, you'll have to do. As for me, I don't want your ""grief counseling."" I don't even remember my sister for the person she was anymore. I remember the ashes that you spilled onto the floor, or when you put them into that ugly ass urn. That's what I remember now. So if you wanted to cremate her so I could have her powdered bones to ""help me cope with losing her,"" then congratulations. This is what you've done, and I hope you're happy. I nearly with there was a hell, a special kind of hell just for you. You'll never know how much you traumatized me. Every night I wake up screaming thinking about my sister being swept up like that. You're disgusting. Fuck you.*",Puzzleheaded_Tree289,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ouz1nl/to_heidi/

I am waiting for my parents to die so that I can follow them,"I am 31 years old and I've been miserable for most of my life. I've been in hospitals, I've been in therapy, nothing has helped.

My life consists of working from home, doing pointless bullshit, then watching TV, playing video games and jerking off.

I have never in my life felt love and I also don't think anyone has ever been in love with me. When you're gay, it's easy enough to get random sex but as I am aging I am getting even uglier so that's not gonna last much longer.

I am ugly, fat, diseased, have bad teeth, atrophied muscles, borderline personality disorder, and just unpleasant to be around.

Since I know if you're lonely at 30 you'll be lonely your entire life because your 20s are when you're building your social network, I know that my life will never change for the better. In fact, it is now changing for the worse.

It's incredibly hard to fall asleep. I am hypersensitive to everything, I just can't get comfortable. It takes 3 or 4 hours every night to fall asleep.

I have no friends, I've never been in a relationship, and nothing can change so what's the point? I would have killed myself long ago but I don't want to hurt my parents in that way. It's not their fault they made the wrong decision to keep me. They couldn't know that I'd turn out to be a genetic freak with no redeeming qualities at all.

A 3rd person point of view, also known as a god's eye view. It sees things in angles, people cant. And is there when at the same time, its not. An illness perhaps, maybe a side unknown by others; secrets. And when i look at myself from this view. I see something thats trying so hard to be great but is nothing but a held up facade. And to every facade, itll someday come down. By force, mistake, or even choice. Itll disappear and the surrounding people will see what it really is.

Im trying really hard to make life easier. But in some angles its making it a thousand times more difficult. I wish i werent born flawed. And maybe i wasnt, maybe it grew or learned.

And I remember thinking that it was self absorbed of me to assume that my family's lives would be destroyed without me, that they all have a lot of other people and things that bring them joy. Writing it out I see the hypocrisy. I basically just see myself dying as a movie in my mind on repeat. I've been in a depressive episode for a few days and know I need to get my medication readjusted, see a psychiatrist and talk to my therapist again. It just feels like these cycles are gonna go on forever.",SnooPies7333,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ov2ckn/i_want_to_die/
Maybe my mother would finally apologize to me if I die,"I just want to die, it's either she dies or I die. She has never loved me, her abuse has made me traumatized. I don't want to live in the same world as her anymore. I also am sick of living in this world for money and just hoping for that retirement in which probably I'm too old to enjoy anything anyway. 

My mother treats me like an accountant and thinks I'm stealing from her or whatever. I have a job and am earning okay but she always doubt me like I'm a stranger. She is not good at math and so she lets me handle her money.

Anyway, it's more like employee and boss relationship. She always asks about her money and never what I'm feeling, always berates my success. 

She had abused me when I was a child, dragged me down the stairs just because I drew on ""expensive dolls"". Hit me several times and made me feel like I don't deserve anything. She has never apologized to me even if she were wrong while I always have to apologize just because I didn't do this petty thing she wants. I remember when I was young, I just forgot to greet ""goodmorning"" or ""goodnight"" and she would throw a huge fit over it. I felt like I was wrong and dumb for not remembering but now that I'm an adult it's just so unreasonable the way she raised me.

Then I have to take care of her because she raised me because in our culture, you give back to your parents or you're ungrateful bitxh. Everyone says not to leave her but they probably don't want to take care of her. 

Everyone downplays the abuse she gave me because it's an asian thing, everyone has been hit by their parents one time. But mine wasn't at all loving or anything, always just this toxic atmosphere that I have to obey or else. She even hits our dog, what do I expect from her.

TLDR: Either I die or my mother dies. I'll probably just die because I don't want to commit a crime. Just want her to apologize and notice what she did to me.",clair_delune26,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ov2bxv/maybe_my_mother_would_finally_apologize_to_me_if/

i know i should get help but all the times ive tried its hard to express because nothings too wrong im just a slightly odd kid with a normal life and i just get invalidated and dismissed for trying to figure out why i am the way i am its fine if im wrong but im just trying to figure it out maybe im not bad enough thats fine i guess. on another account i said id stay alive for this minecraft update and its sorta come out but the magics gone. cool update though but i sorta liked old gen tiny bit more.

Hair loss ruined my self image,"(Throwaway account (23/M)) I have been struggling with depression, anxiety, ADD, BDD, and OCD for many many years, but I have managed it decently well in the past few years. I was actually in probably one of the best mental states of my life a year ago; that was until I noticed I was losing my hair (plus covid ruining the world, but that's another conversation). My hair has always been one of my greatest features, people used to tell me that all the time. It practically defined my personality. About 8 months ago, I started using minoxidil and finasteride (only two meds FDA approved for growing hair). For a while, I was pretty optimistic because I know that my hair wouldn't regrow overnight. It got a smidge better for a little while, but now it is back to the baseline from 10 months ago, if not worse. All day, every day, its all I can think about. I applied for 15 jobs today (I graduated college last year), and all I could think about the entire day was my hair and how awful I feel about myself. I am constantly check my hair in the mirror and feel like shit, or see myself on snapchat. If im not doing that, im probably reading up about something regarding hair loss in a attempt to feel better about myself. I want to find a way to feel better about this. I NEED to find a way to feel better about this or I fear I will go way off the deep end. This issue has consumed almost every waking hour of my life for the past year; spent doing research on hair loss, researching any potential contributing factors, watching youtube videos, reading articles, spending hours on r/tressless etc. I'm so tired. I would do anything to get my hair back to where it was two years ago. I would trade legit anything. I don't think shaving my head is a viable option for me, I think that would legitimately break my brain and make me much more suicidal, depressed, dissociative, etc. I have a constant thought: if I killed myself today, at least I would still have hair during my funeral. I don't know what to do with myself. I hate how I look and I spend every waking minute thinking about it and feeling the need to stare at myself in the mirror. It is inhibiting my social life, I actively avoid meeting new people and seeing friends as often as I used to (Yes, I am seeing a therapist and yes she knows how much I am struggling with this.)

I quit vaping in February of this year, but I picked it up again when I moved in with a friend by hitting his vape almost daily. I feel like this has contributed to my hair loss and makes me feel like absolute shit. I pledged to quit for good last night and I am praying to sweet jesus that my hair might start to grow back and be healthier (nicotine is a vasoconstrictor, so stopping smoking should help me get more blood flow to my scalp). At the same time, I am really itching for a fix, I just know I really shouldnt and I am trying to quit cold turkey, I fear I might lose more hair if I continue my habit.

I don't know why I am posting here, but I just really REALLY needed to get this off my chest in some way. I'm so fucking tired of everything.

My family and friends have no idea how bad my depression is or how often I think about killing myself,"I've been struggling with my mental health and suicidal thoughts since I was 14. I'm 29 now and I wish I had taken my life when I was 14. I always tried to convince myself that things get better but they haven't and they won't. I've never had any dreams or goals in life because I've always known that I wouldn't be alive for long. Whenever I try to talk about how I'm feeling, no one takes it seriously. I broke down in front of my mom telling her everything I had gone through. We both cried together but after that, she hasn't once checked up on me or asked me how I have been. My family and friends are so oblivious to the fact that I don't want to live anymore. My sister is getting tired of me never wanting to go out or see anyone. Even when I try to explain to her that getting out of bed is so hard on it's own, she doesn't understand. I know it's difficult to understand mental health, sometimes I don't even understand my own feelings or thoughts. I just wish someone would ask me how I am doing and to actually be there for me. I always think to myself that I will take my life one day. The only thing that is stopping me from doing so is my family. Sometimes my thoughts are so toxic that I wish I didn't have a family so I can kill myself guilt free. Instead I'm here with a family that loves me and I can never hurt them.

My mom won't pay for my medications anymore.,"Background, I'm 28M,  I've been on a cocktail of different medications for mental health stuff. PTSD, Depression, ADHD, Anxiety, etc. When I was at my lowest, I was drinking an obscene amount and had enough of it. I got help and began my journey of trying to get better. My mom had told me she was more than willing to help with my medications and therapy. Both are not cheap as I do not have insurance. I live in Canada so luckily my therapy is covered however as doctors visits have continued the cost of my medication has increased substantially from around 60 bucks to 280.

While sitting in a vehicle with her yesterday, she brought up  the cost of medication and that it was too much for her or my dad to pay which as absolutely false considering I know they make around 300k a year combined. She then told me that I need to talk to my doctor about getting off medication. I had told her alot of the challenges I face mentally stem from abuse as a child and she immediately became defensive and told me I need to get over it, what's in the past stays in the past, etc. She told me my doctor and therapist are both not good for me and that I need to just get over my past. I yelled at her to shut up and stop talking about it but she persisted. She told me nothing about me has changed, nothing about how I feel has changed and I'm still the same as I was pre medication which is the furthest thing from the truth. I've never been better my entire adult life. I gave her the ultimatum of continuing to help me or I can go back to drinking like it did.  She told me ""you can't hang that over my head"" and the conversation came to a lull for another 2 minutes before I arrived at home. When I got out of the vehicle I looked her in the eyes and said ""you have no idea how close you were to planning my funeral several times to my hand, this has been the only thing that has helped me my whole life. If you don't see that, then fuck you"" and with super hulk angry strength i slammed the door. She peeled off before I could get any of my belongings out. 

Luckily my girlfriend was home as I had instantly had a panic attack and was inconsolable for over an hour, nearly hyperventilating until I passed out. I had really contemplated suicide for the next few hours, one of the only things that held me back in the past was devastating my parents but I'm not even sure if that matters now.

My dad once told me about how we all live in a prison,"My dad once told me about how we live in a prison, and slowly that thought has consumed me. How we are meant to suffer, and life on earth is actually just all of us making eachother miserable. And I feel like everytime I'm on the edge,.. that I'm about to end it, a little piece of hope comes along, just enough to keep me alive, just enough so that I would suffer more. Like when you'd starve a prisoner for 5 days and then give him a piece of bread, so that he stays alive and can get tortured more.


I'm schizophrenic, have been sexually assaulted as a kid, and am struggling with 4 other mental illnesses other than Schizophrenia. And everyday I wake up only to suffer. I can't sleep properly because I have nightmares of the past. I've been going to a psychiatrist but it doesn't help much. The voices are still here, asking me to end it all everyday. And I cannot help but find solace in only that. The idea of ending it.

I recently returned from a cottage trip with my parents and even though the trip was great with lots of hiking and eating out at restaurants i wanted to die the entire time i was there. I didnt feel like their family member i felt like this annoyance that they had to take out on trips so that i would leave. 

I've known for years that my death would come by suicide. But the only thing keeping me going is the knowledge of what that would do to my parents. They treat me so good and for some reason it makes me want to die. It's almost a feeling of ""yeah i get it you love me. I won't kill myself today"".

I wish I was never born.,"Here I am writing this post after crying for an hour, alone in my university dorm.

A quick rundown of what my life is like: I was always a physically small, shy kid that would get bullied for years and years, because of that, my social skills have suffered tremendously and I find it hard to make strong connections with new people. My dad is a very successful business man that has high expectations of me and I am a university student with a STEM major. 

i've struggled with mental illnesses all my life due to getting bullied everyday for years and not telling anyone, I have a few friends who I could call my ""bestfriends"" who I met back in middle school only because they were getting bullied too ( we literally became friends bc we had that in common) and we've been friends ever since (that was like 8 years ago). They got better at socializing and find it easy to make new friends meanwhile i'm still struggling, I always dreamed of having a fun, social life thats full of friends and supportive people but I dont know whats wrong with me because it seems no matter how hard I try, I always fail to make a strong connection with someone new. 

My major in uni is something that I really really love and is something that I want to associate myself with forever, but I'm about to finish my second year of university and I'm doing so bad, I either fail a class completely or barely pass which is absolutely crushing me because I work so hard and spend hours and hours studying but it seems pointless because I still fail no matter what.

so like the title says, I wish I was never born, I dont want to live anymore, I wish I go to sleep one day and I dont wake up, I wish i get hit by a truck and die, I wish there was a button to press to make everyone forget I existed and kill me instantly.

I'm a failure at socializing, I'm a failure at university, I feel so alone and miserable i'm actually sobbing while typing this. I feel like i'm worth nothing and any success that I do have is only because of my dad's success and not my own effort and abilities. 

I would never bring myself to actually suicide because I know how much it would hurt my parents and family and I would never want to put them through that, but every singe day I wish there was a way to make everyone forget about me so I can suicide and end it all.",sthrowaway33242345,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ouirb0/i_wish_i_was_never_born/

I need some things of my chest...,"I've been dealing with mental issues for most of my life and lately, I've considered whether or not it's all worth it. I've had suicidal thoughts for some years now, it's usually brought on by low self-esteem/self-loathing, well it's always that... It most often comes late at night and is gone the next day. The thought of killing myself i mean.  it used to scare me because i didn't really wanna die, but lately, that has changed. I just googled on ""quetiapine overdose"" which is some medication a get, but according to the internet, thats pretty much impossible to OD on. Which is good i guess... I've pretty much stopped talking to all of my friends, and they dont really contact me neither. I've got a brother who knows that my mental state isnt always good.  He insist on me talking to him about it, but everytime i do, i can see the hurt and frustraion in him. One time he told me to go ahead and do it if thats what i wanted, he regretted it right after, but i can't help but feel thats what would be best for him and everyone else around me. I lost my father to cancer back in 2015, i smoked alot of weed back then, and while he was laying on his deathbed all i wanted to do was go home and smoke instead of being there for him. I regret that so much. But at least his death gave me the shove i needed so i could quit smoking and finish me education. I was really close with my mother, see had alot of mental problems too and drank alot, and when i finished my education she got sick and got into a nursing home (she wasnt old, it was just a place that could help her) so she could recover. I had planned to go there with my brother and aunt to see her, but i called it of at the last second. I couple of days later she was put in a hospital because she wasnt doing to good. The next day she went into a coma and never woke up again (we believe that she might have OD on her meds, but the doctor wasnt sure). I can't help but feel like a might have been able to do something about it if I hadnt pussied out... I can still see her lying in the hospital bed with her mouth open. I just feel like a piece of shit who's never gonna amount to anything and end up like my mother. I'm just hurting the people around me and giving them things to worry about.

"I legitimately feel ready to die, please help.","Recently a u haul with everything I own was stolen while I was moving. It’s the worst feeling I can remember in my whole life. 


Anyways earlier today I was talking to my dad and he was lashing out at me for every little thing because he was stressed about his shop business or something related. 

I asked him why he’s treating me that way and responding in such an angry way and he started screaming and threatening to hang up the phone. 

I started crying and begging him to stop and so he did hang up the phone which basically floored me for the whole day unable to enjoy anything. This is on top of everything I own getting stolen. 

I tried calling him later and asking him
To please apologize and he started saying, “If you say I was being mean, then I apologize” but I told him that’s not an apology that really would make me feel better and he jumped all over me again and told me he would hang up on me or leave the phone and let me talk to myself. 

And so he did, and I cried and cried and before writing this I was considering suicide. My mom is even more cruel than my father and so I always thought I could rely on him but him taking this route makes me feel I’m all alone in the world and want to die. 

I even asked my dads sister for help my aunt, she said sure and seemed concerned, and then I never heard from her again. It makes me feel entirely alone. It’s a torture nobody should have to endure.

I’m so depressed I can barely move. Nothing works.,"Someone could light me on fire right now and I don’t think I’d feel it. I’m trying to exercise, can barely pick up the weight. When I finally finish a set and drop the weight I feel like I need to scream or cry but I can’t, I don’t have the energy to spare. I thought exercise was supposed to make you feel better. Just like I thought eating healthy was supposed to make you feel better. And therapy. And medication. But it doesn’t.

I’m so depressed I feel drunk. I’m tired, everything looks hazy and I don’t feel entirely real. Nothing’s even happened. I’m just back in this pit. I’m always make it back here. I don’t think I ever really even get out. Think sometimes the lid comes off and a bit of light shine down for a second, just enough to remind me what I’m missing, then I blink and it’s gone. Now it just hurts my eyes.

I don’t have anyone around, not really. In lockdown, so I don’t even see strangers. I live with my mum and her husband but I try to have nothing to do with them. Only here cause covid ruined me. Wouldn’t have anything to do with either of them otherwise. Definitely can’t talk to her, just have to do my best to seem like I’m fine cause it’s not worth the trouble. If she knew I was suicidal she’d probably try to get me institutionalised. I just have to sit there and look for any escape while she delivers her daily rant at me about how “the vaccine is killing people and she can’t possibly get it and I shouldn’t either” or some similar garbage, trying not to let my face or words betray the fact that I’m thinking about the quickest available way to fucking end myself. No one even knows I’m getting this severe. They don’t even know I’m depressed. Not that I’d want them to.

I feel like a straitjacket lunatic, who doesn’t even have the energy to rock back and forth. I don’t know why I’m posting this. If therapy and medication can’t help me, no one on here will be able to. Besides hearing things like “it gets better” isn’t a comfort, because it does until it doesn’t. Yes, it does get “better”. For a day. If I’m lucky. And even “better” isn’t what it was, the graph might have peaks and valleys, but it’s been steadily trending downwards for as long as I can remember.

I want to die so bad,"

  I dont know where to start, I dont want to continue living, it seems a sick thought but it is not (at least for me) and nothing fills me enough to suffocate this feeling which I have had for a while, the only thing that dissuades me a little It's videogames and hanging out with my friends (which I don't do much even though they're my brothers) but when no one is around, I just think about dying.

 I have never lacked anything, I havent  gone through any traumatic situation or I have depression or anything, I have no reason why I could explain to someone why I want to die.

 My will to live ""simply"" has vanished. If I could change my life for that of someone who really feels that he wants and wants to live, but cannot for any other cause much more serious and understandable than mine, I would do it without thinking about it, that way I would have a valid excuse.

I hope you at least have the courage to tell them how you fucking feel. Tell them how much you hate them. Tell them how much you hate both of them how they’ve ruined your fucking life.

I hate them all for making me live through this hell this long I hate them for fucking lying to me. I hate them all. I wish I could kill them.

I hate Jessica. I hate Anna. I hate Julie. I hate Sarah. I hate Tayler. I hate Macy. I hate Leaf. I hate Turtle. I hate all of them.

You’ve spent the past 7 years of your life online making good for nothing “friends” just so you can “escape” and be “healthy”. And look where you are now.

They can’t help you. They don’t want to help you. They have their own problems to deal with and you don’t even have the kindness to help them with those things.

You should have left for good. You should have cut them all off so that way you wouldn’t go back crying to them. You keep getting distracted. You shouldn’t have ever met them Elisa.

Voluntary hospital admission for mental health,"I've had an experience as involuntary (never again), where there was a specific time period that was higher stress/risk and so it vaguely made sense that they were holding me there.

But I'm also not sure my intent is high enough that I would be able to actually go through with things, versus just obsessing about it and wanting to have enough intent to follow through.

I use to be a  very social individual before the age of 16 I've never dated irl cause I found more comfort in long distance relationships, and honestly I really want to make one work so I can meet that someone irl however no matter my dedication and no matter the comitement it usually fails. I have close to zero friends online and I never really show whenever I'm sad or depressed cause I know how annoying it can be for people... well until now. I've been in and out of long distance relationships for a while and well currently have been trying to keep one going as I can visit that someone is 3-4 months, however I feel as if she's not really giving me enough attention. we do talk a lot sometimes but usually she's out with her friends (some of them are guys) she did reassure me she was gonna wait but when I ask her to text me sometimes she just never does until I do (this is when she's out with friends) it can last for 4-6 hours and even when I text her she barely replies. I've been trying to make a stable relationship cause that is the only thing in life that I feel like can actually make me happy. I've been lonely for too long and if this relationship fails I feel as if I'm gonna give up and just kill myself

there’s already a flaw,"you know how college is another chapter another step to take in life? the step that i’ve romanticized for a long time. well, now the time is coming where i actually have to stop dissociating from my reality and actually care about myself. i’ve just never loved myself and never faced my trauma fully and never wanted to live in the present or future. and now, it’s really like what’s the point? i can’t love myself properly and therefore i can’t love anyone else properly. i looked forward to college because i wanted to meet people who understood me and i wanted to come into myself. but what if i never love myself? what if all of this planning and suffering is for nothing? the cycle of being alone just repeats. i’ve been really unlucky in my childhood up to this point and i feel so broken. so much work ahead of me and it just all seems so predictable. what should i do? thank you.",Lucky_Strawberry7822,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ouvljt/theres_already_a_flaw/

I thought I was getting better now everything just seems pointless.,"Yesterday was the first time in about a year that I had seriously began to contemplate suicide again. I’ve been slowly slipping back into depression and it just feels like a giant hole that you took so long to dig yourself out of and then you fall back in. I don’t have the energy to climb back out because I know sooner or later I’ll just fall back in. So what’s even the point. I know I’m only 18 but I just feel like I have no energy to go about life so why even bother. Why even put all this energy to feel the same. Im not loved by anyone. I just want affection in my life but can’t find it in partners or my parents. Things with my parents used to be so bad, now it’s improved so much but I can’t let things go. And I don’t know why I’m expected to. They love me of course but I resent them for never giving me the affection I needed and that every child deserves when they were young. I never got that “my child is my whole world” type of being raised and it’s something I always wanted for myself. And I will never get it. I look for that kind of unconditional love in partners. But that doesn’t exist because relationships should be conditional otherwise it’s not healthy. I will never be satisfied with someone who does not love me unconditionally. I just won’t. I know it’s not healthy but it’s how my mind thinks. I can’t change it. I cannot. Nothing I think of myself is good and no one tells me otherwise. For once I just want someone to see good in me. But I know I can’t expect that and I need to love myself first. But I don’t, and I can’t. So what’s the point.

Done everything I can... Do I give up? Is it over?,"I've been on 20+ meds that all supposedly work for my gene type, seen 16 therapists all with different styles of therapy, done a round of TMS, ketamine infusions, been to the hospital, what else do I do? Why is everyone parroting ""it gets better"" even though they know what all I've been through? Is it some cruel joke that everyone wants to keep you alive and miserable when there's no hope?

The only things I see left I can do are ECT, which my insurance doesn't cover so it would blow all my savings and more. And it might screw up my memory to the point where I have to die anyways. And psilocybin which is illegal except for clinical trials that aren't in my area. Found a method and been wondering when to end it. Sucks that I can't even tell anyone about my plans because they'd make it so I'm trapped further in the prison that is life.

The worst part is everyone I talk to about this is giving up on me, saying they've said all they can or just that I'm not trying when I've done everything. So in the process when I need friends the most they're all leaving. And I can't even talk about positive things because I hate everything. At the same time I'm scared to go because eternal nothingness is terrifying, but what other choice do I have?

Disabled and useless.,"I'm at the end of my rope and it's scaring me. It really feels like there's no way out. 

Summary of life; Neglected by my mom as a child, took care of myself and was told the bullying at school is not her business. At 13 I stop going cause I can't take the torture and anxiety. I get dragged from one shrink to another, I get no help only blame for being a spoiled brat. Threatened to get taken away. My dad screaming at me daily about how useless I'll be if I don't go to school.

I meet people online, old men who say I'm mature for my age, I let them masturbate to me while I sit there naked on cam. At 16 I meet my first boyfriend, he rapes me. 2 years later and we're done I meet the most abusive piece of shit ever, who does much worse for 3 years. 

School is still not a thing despite going from one school to another, it doesn't work it, makes me suicidal. At 20 I get my autism diagnosis, I wasn't just a spoiled brat. I then get something called MdDs. Horrific brain disorder. 

Last few years I've worked through the anxiety and ptsd. I thought I was ok, could start my life but then mdds flares up and is now making life unbearable, and it'll never go away. Just up and down. 
I can't do anything on my own any more. I need help for every single thing. 

I'm completely useless, I feel guilty for breathing. I'm crying daily because I shouldn't be allowed to breathe. I can't do anything.

"21 Hypochondriac with chronic pain, severe anxiety/depression, and feeling lost.","I apologize in advance for this disorganized rant. 

So I've never struggled with suicidal thoughts as much as i have right now. I nearly died from dehydration due to me neglecting self care recently due to severe anxiety, and when I get anxiety i tend to feel paralyzed and hopeless. I don't even have much of an appetite and i didn't even realize i was so severely dehydrated because i didn't even feel thirst. My heart was skipping beats and my legs were swelling and my skin was strangely elastic, it was honestly horrifying and i didn't want to die actually and experienced terrifying delirium and psychosis like thoughts which i read happens with dehydration . I was also using THC 24/7 and developed a bit of an addiction to it, and i realize that made things worse for me although it helped temporarily with anxiety. I've dealt with chronic pain of all kinds on and off since 16 now 21 and I've had severe anxiety and fear over it and treated it through a variety of means which did help by seeing chiropractors and different people(but i could never get full relief and would literally end up in all kinds of pain after sitting in a position for more then an hour, i would feel frustrated that i was so young dealing with back pain and nerve pain).  In an extremely anxious state i bought something to help with my jaw pain online because i was frustrated that i wasn't getting results i was satisfied with  from different therapies(which was a dumb decision), but i think it made everything so much worse.  And i feel INTENSE brain fog and ive been feeling my arms and legs losing sensation and just bad pains throughout my body. Doctors don't know why and chiropractic isn't helping anymore like it used to. I'm terrified of living info a future where i get physically and mentally worse, and I've felt extreme brain fog and limb weakness for weeks. I don't have much of a hope of getting cured as I've seen so many doctors and people, and i have a ton of guilt and self hatred because i unintentionally made myself worse and i didn't trust my gut feelings but instead gave into anxiety. I'm angry and sad that I've had these anxious tendencies and hypochondriac like behaviors my whole life, along with actual chronic pain from 17 that made me stop a lot of things I've loved doing.  I've realized that hypochondria is a mild form of psychosis as well so now i wonder if I've had more severe mental problems then I've previously thought. Also I've been battling so much religious trauma for being gay and i feel so restricted and trapped in my body and mind and situation  and like I'm floating in a fog 24/7. I believe that a lot of my physical pain came from trauma as well. My spine is basically messed up on an x-ray and at the age of 21 i have a super straight neck curve with thinning discs and my hands tremor, so I'm not imagining the pain and symptoms i have, but i realize the anxiety about it makes it worse, and now it's actually more concerning due to me buying a mouth piece to help my jaw pain that i never actually got formally diagnosed with. I want to drop dead at times and just desire instant death, but i also don't want to hurt my family or friends around me(all my friends are moving away and i feel like a completely different person), and I'm scared of what happens next if i do decide to end it. I believe in an afterlife and God, but i believe suicide would just make me either have to repeat everything all over again, or stunt my growth, or put me in an even more hellish state. I'm scared to live, scared to die, have moments of happiness , and deep moments of sadness. I've been in an intense brain fog state 24/7 for months, and also dealing with headaches and strange pain that I'm having trouble resolving either from my accidental dehydration, or my messed up spine or both. I've had hopes and dreams to go to college and travel and do things, but the jobs i want require you to be mentally and physically healthy and i feel like i can barely walk sometimes because my legs feel so heavy. I've always been sensitive and terrified of life and making mistakes, but also had times of great excitement and motivation in the past, but now everything seems hopeless and i feel like i have an invisible illness that no one can help me with, and I've lost all joy in the previous passions and goals I've had. So I'm just going day by day and not even thinking about the future cause i don't even see myself living past 30 and i don't want to right now. I have moments of happiness interspersed with the anxiety/depression/pain, but for months now there is this constant overwhelming sense of hopelessness, numbness, sadness, and physical pain that is minor most of the time but gets much worse at random times, and the brain fog from my jaw discomfort is soooo overwhelming and i can't even think. I just find it overwhelming existing in this mortal flesh of emotional and physical discomfort. I'm not even sure how to help myself anymore as the therapies i used before aren't helping anymore. I thought life was supposed to be fun and we were supposed to get better overtime, but I've gotten worse in every single way and i realize i have myself to blame for my mistakes due to anxiety , and i can't stand existing with myself and living with this physical and mental situation. So that's my rant of the day lol. I also forgot to mention ive been battling severe social anxiety lately as well and am very sensitive to nearly everything. I wish I could be emotionally stable like other people i see around me (although i don't know their inner thoughts ). I fantasize about dehydrating myself again, drowning myself, or hanging myself. But these feelings come with an overwhelming sense of guilt and self hatred because my family does care about me which I'm thankful for, although they are responsible for so much of my emotional trauma. I also do believe in a higher power, and when i was dehydrated severely there were some events that happened that confirmed my belief in a higher power, but i feel so confused and upset to have these anxious tendencies and physical things.",DreamCuruzGo,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ouv2zx/21_hypochondriac_with_chronic_pain_severe/

"Not about me, is this allowed? I'm worried"," Hello everyone,

I am asking for help with this situation:

I  have met a young woman on the internet, she seems like a really nice  person... unfortunately she is struggling with anorexia and a number of  other mental health issues I cannot even begin to list in full.

She  is 22 years old, she lives in the Ukraine. She currently weighs 22.5  kgs (=49.6 lbs), but she has told me that her weight was once as low as  17.8 kgs (=39.2 lbs). As recently as a couple of months ago, she weighed  19 kgs (=41.9 lbs). After that she was admitted to a hospital, where  she was forced to gain the amount she weighs now and was dismissed from  the hospital not too long ago. The best I can tell, she has struggled  with anorexia for around 6 years now. She is tired of it. She tells me  she is still attempting to lose weight, but while at one point she did  it for the thinness itself, at this point she just wants herself to die  trying. She values herself and her life as a negative (or at best a 0)  to society. She repeatedly told me she isn't even worth the effort she  puts into starving to death and that she never even could kill herself  properly using this method as she ""has no self-control"". This is the  only part of her messages i regard as a white lie, since she clearly has  already arrived at life-threatening weights.

Her  family either doesn't care for her or doesn't understand her problem,  it is probably a combination of the two (she has told me both things),  so she cannot turn to them. The best part of this horrible story is that  she is not completely dismissive of seeking mental health support,  though she has told me that she has a bad experience with the local  psychologist of the small town she inhabits. She would probably require a  bit of convincing to actually call/visit a professional. I have  searched for ukrainian mental health hotlines she could call, but the  best I could tell, all of them are either reserved for the veterans of  the war in eastern Ukraine or not toll-free (she is from a poor  background, she has just enough money to support herself, or maybe not  even that much. She tells me she hasn't got any money on her phone for  calls). I haven't asked but she probably does not speak English, only  Russian and Ukrainian, I am communicating with her through an online  translation site, most of the time, the message comes across.

What can I do now?

If  you can, please leave advice in the comments (or message me, that's  fine too). Feel free to ask for more details if you think it helps. Any  offers of help are greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time.",Traditional-Price286,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ouukv7/not_about_me_is_this_allowed_im_worried/
I feel like I died years ago,"I recently made it to 26 and as the more time passes, the more I realize I did not expect to live this long. I've tried to think of a future where I have a career, family, and take my meds consistently. A timeline where I don't feel so alone all the time, or like a bad person, or even less broken. None of them feel real. Instead, I am greeted by the feeling that this is either purgatory or my death should happen soon. I wish that I'd been successful in my serious attempt from 5 years ago. Then I wouldn't have had to deal with all of my friends abandoning me. I wouldn't have to feel this alone. I wouldn't be consumed by these thoughts to the point I cannot focus on my work. I would have limited the wake of my devastation. I wouldn't be fighting with providers to get the medication I need. I wouldn't be here, alive, awake today, and that sounds like a better reality. Maybe I won't make it to 27. That's always been another thought. As much as I want to feel loved, at home, and to support others, I'd rather leave this all behind for the great eternal darkness that awaits us all. 

When I was younger, one of the many beliefs of my suicide, was that I was meant to die to force others to connect to each other. That my purpose was to help, leave, and cause the people dealing with it to come together. As that pops up more and more each day, I don't feel that mindset is off. If I had a funeral, it would force my friends to see each other again. Maybe they would see it as a need to reach out to each other more often. Maybe they would hang out more as they attempted to navigate their pain if they feel anything at all. Maybe my family would check on each other more often as well. It feels wrong to think my death would have any impact on those around me. I'm not as ignorant to assume they would have a party, but that I mattered enough to them for this to be lasting doesn't seem real either. Maybe this is my personal hell. I have no pleasure in what I do and live to get through the day-to-day. I have been done with waking up tomorrow for most of my life. I'm too bad at killing myself to find a way to get it right. Maybe I should try harder. 

I am replaceable. I am insignificant. My place in the lives of those around me and the world could not matter less. Though others say they care about me, I do not care about me. I don't want to be here and have spent my time attempting to build enough goodwill for this incredibly selfish act. Why is it so hard to not be here? Why do I keep waking up? I am doing nothing but wasting the time and resources of those around me. I wish for nothing more than to no longer be here. If I make it to 27, that will still be too long of a life.",maitvoid,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oufwnh/i_feel_like_i_died_years_ago/

It's all my fault,"For 6 years I've convinced myself that it's not my fault. It's the education system, society, my family, etc. I kept saying that what I did was okay because I was scared and it was for my mental health. Never really got better and in fact it went worse.

How could I betray these people? They want nothing but the best for me and I ruined it. I ruined their expectations, their wishes for me but most of all I've ruined my future. I don't know how to get back up from this. In all of those 6 years I had to keep a lie every single day and I feared every single second that passes by thinking I'd be found out.

I've kept that lie for so long it's bound to get revealed soon and when it does I hope that I am not here anymore. I don't think I can ever bear to let them know. Call me a coward but I don't really give a fuck. I can only keep it up for 2 more months. After that...I don't even want to know what will happen.

I've prepared 5 plans to end it. I can keep going if all of them fail. I have to. I don't want them to see me. I don't want them to know. I will take this lie to the grave. I'll even lie about the note I'll leave.

Can't stop thinking about it,"I've been vividly imagining how I would kill myself. What I'd use, where and when I'd do it, what I'd put in my suicide notes, what my advanced directive will say. I've planned out the details, with a kind of generic timeframe. I keep prying my mind off those thoughts, reminding myself that I can't afford to be dead. Or worse, severely injured. Not yet, anyway. It's tentative on a couple of variables. Not so much ""if"" I'll do it, but more of ""when"" I'll be able to. The part of me that's still scared of dying feels so distant, now. So small. Part of me still doesn't want to do it. But it's so hard to fight a losing battle. I feel like things would be better for me and those around me if I simply wasn't here. And I feel like I'm slowly descending into early dementia and/or psychosis, like there's not much time left for me, anyway. Maybe I'm paranoid. But I still fear being a crazy old thing everyone tries to forget exists. But I also deeply fear death. So I'm just in a perpetual state of fear. And it's becoming unbearable. I just want to feel normal. Maybe even happy. Just... For a while. Just once.

"Sooooo I'm close to ""clocking out"" and I'm pretty much grasping at straws at this point....","So I don't use Reddit alot, mostly just Facebook, if anything.... But its really hard to talk about adult things on Facebook....
I apologize in advance for redundancies or ramblings... I'm not fully prepared for what I might say....

I am a 30 something white male, that as fought mental health issues for atlest 20 of them and first tried to clock out @ 21.... My mental health has steadily declined since then....
Ive been locked up(mental/drug ward) at least a dozen times, and probably half of them were voluntary. Now I don't know how many people know this, but if you don't have the best insurance and/or are willing to pay an exuberant amount of money, the ""mental health system"" is a joke, and a nightmare, and EMBARRASSING(I live in north Carolina, unites states) let me just tell you about my last rodeo....
I went to am emergency room at about 2 a.m. because ive once again convinced myself my daughter didnt deserve to see me like that. 
As soon as I get there and they know why I'm there im put in a room, stripped down to a gown, and everything is taken out of this room, a memeber of security then pats me down, I'm asked triage questions and told to wait....
I spend the next 40 hours in this room watching tv and eating what is available..... Im the middle of an active ER.... With nothing but my socks and underwear....
Oh and they confinscate your meds(if you have them, and if your homeless,you have them all) and since your here under watch they wont be giving you anything....

Now think about that.... I'm walking in and immediately all my depression and anxiety meds are taken from me. Now, I'm in an ER so I'm gonna see a doctor and they will make sure I have what I need while I'm here right?..... Guess again.

Sometime during this 2 days of hell I see a doctor over a television that needs to decide what to do with me.... If the fact that they roll this doctor into see you on a 1991 zenemax tv isn't making you depressed.... Well it explains why your reading and not typing...

So now I finally get told where I'm going... And then you have to wait for transportation. Do you know who transports patients who are under lockdown observation?  The police.
Want to guess what I have to put on before we go for this exciting ride? Noooo not clothes.... I'm still mostly neeked sans my shoes which no longer have laces.... No I have to be shackled... Hands AND feet (I'm not fucking lying, I have taken THIS exact trip 4 fucking times) and then I'm placed in the back of a cop car (except the one time I got extra lucky and got to go on a 4 hour ride shackled to a paddy wagon)
And all of this is just the price Of admission... Haven't even started on the next 1 too 2 weeks....

Soooo... 
1)My mental health issues are at a stand still untill I have money or insurance.
2)I can't work because of my mental health.
3)The government disagrees.

Ive spent all my life trying to get off this swing of starting to get help and then everything collapsing and falling over....

My friends and family all tell me im so smart and Articulate and that I should be changing the world.... But I can't realize that because ive been stuck in the same place since I was like 10 years old...

Ive reached out too every one I know and most everyone I don't and everybody has the time to pat you on thr back and tell you to call the 1800 number, but no body has the money to help me get a doctor...
I'm not mad tho. I get it. You have your own problems, but,   come on guys lets be honest.... We'd all rather say ""I wish there was something I could have done"" then be late on rent.

Nothing really matters anymore,"I’ve dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for years but right now I feel so incredibly depressed and I want to kill myself because I feel that there is something fundamentally wrong with me. I have a loving boyfriend, an amazing and accepting family, a job that pays my rent, and the sweetest little fur babies, but in spite of all of that I still feel worthless and like there’s no reason to keep going. More and more lately I just want to be alone and away from everyone so I can lie down and sleep and just try not to dwell on how I feel. I can’t even force myself to do the things that have once made me happy because I have no will to do anything and I’m so tired mentally and physically all the time. I can barely even eat anymore and it’s been affecting my energy levels so much that I literally cannot conjure up happy thoughts of force myself to get up off the couch or bed.

The suicidal cycle is always fun,"Nothing like being happy and sane and immediately throwing that all away for zero reason.  Can’t afford rent this month and likely going to be evicted, cellular about to be cut off, car is about to break down - all because of a good ol gambling addiction I know I can’t break.  

I guess none of it really matters.  If I look rationally at things I don’t really make life better for people.  I made the bad decision every time instead of moving forward.  Crows have come to roost.  Just hoping I don’t pussy out again but I inevitably will.  I guess I’ll have my mental breakdown again, fail at suicide, and then have to beg my dad who hates what I’ve become for money for rent.  He probably won’t do it for good reason and then I’m just fucked.

Idk there aren’t silver linings.  Everyone I cared about no longer cares about me.  I’m just not a good person anymore.  Maybe I was always this shitty bastard.

Just want to be out of pain,"I’ve been suffering with chronic pain from endometriosis for the past 10 months now and got surgery 6 months ago with no improvement since then. The pain from endo got worse and the constipation associated with it is horrible. My bowels never function by themselves anymore. I hate my job where I’m underpaid and undervalued, but I can’t leave it because I may have to go to another specialist out of state and my insurance benefits out of state are great, where they wouldn’t normally be at other jobs I’ve been offered. I’m also still dealing with a breakup from 9 months ago because I’m pathetic and he never talks to me and is honestly probably doing amazing without me. I know he’s already dating, so that’s awesome, especially since he told me I’d scarred him from dating forever.

I just honestly don’t see my life improving and at this point I just want it to end. I’m tired of feeling numb until I eventually have a random breakdown. And I’m tired of trying to make myself happier by hanging out with friends or going out for food or drinks, which later just make me bloated and want to throw up because I know that shit is not coming out on its own without a laxative. I just want to die. I fantasize about ways I could die where I wouldn’t have to end things myself because I’m too cowardly, but I feel like I’m just getting closer and closer to buying a gun and just making it stop.

I’m somehow, never the same person you met,

At how the fire’s burning, but you’re gassing it up,
And I’m filling your cup with gasoline,
It’s funny how you kick while I’m down.

And while I’m upside down,
You’re taking the run around,
And if no ones around,
You sink the blade in a little deeper.

Not deep enough to kill me, 
That’d be too easy,
Just deep enough, so I take the knife out,
And use it on myself, just to get it over with. 

Why not let me suffer?
Why not make it last as long as you can?
Every day already drags on,
Why not squeeze out every last second?

I hope you fucking love it. 
I hope you love it so much you don’t come back,
Cause I’m just about don’t with this shit.

It’s a lie. 

You wanna hear me laugh?

I’m planning on killing myself when I return home.,"I’ve been away. My never-ending episode is getting worse, and everything is getting worse. I’m tired of forcing myself to believe things will get better. If they were going to get better they would have already. I try to improve on my own but I can’t. I need to go to a ward but I can’t. I need professional help but I can’t. Being awake and stuck with these awful thoughts and feelings… It’s exhausting. For 8 months straight, every. Single. Day. Has been the same. It’s relentless. I’m drowning in myself. I can’t go on much longer. As each day passes something new within me is born. Something awful and vicious. It’s always something. I don’t catch a break. My mom is dead, my dad abandoned me, I’m a burden to my grandmother. I have no friends. My boyfriend makes things worse. I have no reason to keep going, everything I loved and everything I had is long gone, never to return. I’ve attempted before without the intention of dying but instead as a cry for help. Four times. Nobody cared. This time I want to be gone, and I want to stay gone. I’m tired. I have no resolve left in me. So, we have prescribed pills all over our house from my dead grandfather (who sexually abused me and died in front of me), I’m sure I can take enough and make a deadly enough combination so that it kills me before my grandma has the chance to find me. If I can’t, I can hang myself. I’ve always liked how it feels to be choked, it probably won’t be too bad. I’ll leave a suicide note with my phone password and instructions to text my boyfriend and give him a letter as well. I’ve made up my mind. I’m ready to die.

Maybe I'm not, i don't know to be honest. Being left with trust issues and no self esteem.

I've been wanting to kill myself since when I was 10.,"Please don't PM me. I don't want to personally message anyone. It makes me nervous. 

I don't have the energy to kill myself. Wish I could, but I don't want to upset and traumatise my family over my death. 

Growing up, I have a feeling that I will not live past 30+ years old, and that feeling has been around since when I was 10. Why? During my early childhood, I witnessed my parents arguing a lot over financial issues, mom almost murdering my dad with a knife. We weren't wealthy or well-off back then when my parents had me. 

Now that I looked back, I wished my parents learnt to focus on their finances than giving birth to me. Not to mention, I have a disability as well which is Autism. Both of them refused to believe about my disability from a doctor (Which has a stigma in Asian cultures.) And I end up wondering why the fuck I was so different from the rest of the kids for the rest of my childhood. 

I suffered from social awkwardness, wondering why were people shocked at my odd responses, being bullied, not knowing how to healthily cope, or accidentally annoy the people around me because I didn't hear them clearly for the first time. 

How do I cope these days? Most of the time, I cope by watching gore videos to deal with these thoughts. Listening to Black Metal, Death Metal, whatever.

 I've accepted that I'm a disease to everyone around me, and that I'm a mistake by birth. I've always wished I've never been born into this life as a young kid. God, I just want to die peacefully.

I am so done with my useless life.,"I don't even know where to begin.

I'm so unhealthy in mind, body and spirit that I feel so trapped. Even the most basic things like hygiene have been a problem for so long that they stress me out to say nothing of having a job and having long term plans. I just subsist here relying on people who now hate my presence and tell me so everyday. I hate my dependency, but I don't know how to handle things myself.

On top of not being able to handle my own life, I cannot stop thinking about the world. I cannot stop thinking about all the hatred, ignorance and power-tripping involved in the operation of the world. We're killing the planet and no one is actually doing anything substantial to stop it. The concept of truth and the foundations of knowledge have been eroded to the point where everything has become this Nietzschean competition to be or not to be on the basis of your very own rules.

And I cannot make my own rules/meaning/goals. How can you strive for any dreams when your ""nose"" for happiness is gone? How do you move towards anything at all and commit to anything when everything normal and necessary in this world wears you out to the point of wanting to leave after five seconds?

 One day just slips into the next. I pass the time with passive activities and never leave the house. All my efforts to be employed have involved me quitting due to the stress of not being able to handle normal life. And I hate myself for it. I hate myself for my weakness. I hate myself because people taught me to hate myself. 

I lost my will to live over the last ten years. My self-respect is gone and there's not any fertile part of my being in which something like self-compassion can grow. People die for lack of love; you can wither from hating yourself. I've withered through my 20s and now my 30s are here for me to shrivel out of existence in. Will it be my liver or my heart that goes from my unhealthiness? 

No, I just want things to be quick now. I've cut myself off from people. My family is sick of me, even the supportive ones don't know what to do. I don't blame them. Therapy doesn't help. Drugs don't help. You need something to keep going, to push back against all the grayness in the world.

I don't have a part of me that wants to push back. I just want to be like dust in the wind or an echo that fades or a memory which becomes unremembered. 

I hate myself. I hate this world.Why do I have to hold on? I can't hold on for others. And looking at this planet, what good is there being alive when you're just fodder for a destructive cancer of unchecked economic activity? What's the point of making compassionate suicide so hard. 

It's not like something acute happened. I became an adult and I've failed. I want out. I want a mutual divorce from this life without having to pretend superficially in hope. I can't believe in hope. Hope doesn't take root in me.

I want to let go. I just want there to be an easy way to let go and be done with all of it. All the failure. All the health and mental problems. All the feelings of stress and shame swelling up in my body and forming the background state of my existence. I can't take this anymore. 

Other people can have the space, resources and energy I take up with my continued existence. This is a party I didn't plan and it's not one I want to stay at just for the sake of the thing itself. As for me, I just don't care. I never really did. And I don't know how to care or to learn to care.

Nothing gets my jazzed. Nothing gets me through. I can barely focus on an activity and don't get anything out of things emotionally or ""motivationally"". Lots of this is because I don't try hard enough (or is this my parent's talking in me?).

It's all been stuck deep into me that I don't deserve to be happy and that I make myself unhappy. If I make myself un-happy and can't change, then why not unmake myself. Continuing just seems like a lost cause which will bring down most of all the more loving and supportive people in my life until they hate me just as much as my parents. Call this an apoptosis of the individual human as opposed to a cell; I know I am dysfunctional so this is the process of limiting my effect on everything through self-destruction.

That's it. That's all I want to say. Life goes on and on too long for someone like me. I'm happy that other people find meaning here and can grow and can put aside the things they cannot control to ""keep on keeping on"" and otherwise find the joy in things. I just don't. Nothing has helped, and I always destroy any tiny bit of progress I can make for myself in the space of three weeks by falling back into terrible habits for spans of months to years.

I'm tired people. I'm so tired of having so little to show for myself, no ideas on how to mange to get to get my shit together and no energy to change.

"If things wouldn't change for the better, I'm going to die at 32","I'm 28 now. My life sucks. It always has been like that. I have several mental disorders including severe anxiety. I'm scared of everything. Even death. I'm so tired. I tried to kill myself 3 times when I was 18/19. Couldn't go through it because of the love that I have for my parents. Also I was afraid that I would go to hell. 

So I tried to get improved. I have done everything I can, but it still the same. I still live with my parents, and don't have any skill an adult should have. I'm not allowed to go out alone. I don't know how to handle adult problems. Other than one freelance writing job, which I quit after 2 months, I never done anything other than getting a bachelors and a masters degree from low rank universities. I didn't try to get enrolled in better universities, because all of them require to sit for an interview and with my anxiety and panic attacks it is impossible. 

Because of a significant figure in my life I was brought up in a very sheltered household and I'm still like that. 

My siblings had a different life. One of them is doing a phd in a reputable uni and she's only 22. And other one is a senior software engineer and he's getting married next month. Both of them have really good personalities and social skills. They are fluent in English too, which is highly valued in my country. I'm suck at everything.

Plus I'm gay. And I live in a homophobic country. I don't know how, but I found a quarantine gf. She lives far away. We've never met irl. Just video calls. I can't go there, because I don't know how to drive or take a bus. Also I'm not allowed. She said she will come to meet me once the lockdown is over. 

She wants to go abroad. But I don't have any skill a country would find useful. Even my degrees are useless in other countries.

Since my brother is getting married and he can move out from house. But because I'm gay I might have to live in this house forever, with the person I mentioned. She's not my mom. My parents are good people. But they were always too busy to notice the abuse.

I was mentally abused my whole life and I was sexually assaulted this year. 

I'm a coward. I don't want to die. If things got at least a bit better I will never do it. If things stayed the same, I'm definitely going to die at 32. I picked 32, because astrologers (I don't believe astrology that much, but it's the only hope I have) say that my life will improve by 32.

Like all these years I will try my best to get better. But if I failed, I don't want to suffer anymore than that. 32 years is more than enough.",lonelydaydreamer93,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oukmfg/if_things_wouldnt_change_for_the_better_im_going/

Do I die inside or just die?,"TW: transphobia, suicidal thoughts

The way my parents tell me that they won't support me no matter what. That I'm ""unnatural"" and when I say why don't you learn about it they just say it doesn't concern us so we won't, they don't want to learn nor support and then the it's just a phase. You just got caught up in this thing about you being trans and aren't willing to listen to anyone who tells you otherwise. IT'S MY FUCKIN IDENTITY DAMN IT. HOW THE FUCK CAN OTHERS DEFINE IT FOR ME. I'm having suicidal thoughts even while on anti-depressants. I don't trust anyone. I feel like I have to choose between whether I die inside everyday or just die.

I wanna transition real badly or I can wait 4-6 years to do it but then I'm afraid I won't look good and further I can't concentrate on studies very well with other stuff on my mind, it was the same when I was in school I didn't even touch my books even for finals I was escaping to the max. Now I know who I am.

Nope I don't see a future for myself as a man, I just am not, why can't they try to understand me. Of course I can understand them all they care about is the society, I did too and I got my answer, either no one gives a fuck or else haters and ignorant assholes. Do not mind them and we will be cool.

If I didn't drop out due to depression I would have gotten a job next year perhaps. Wish I knew about myself earlier so I could plan what to do.

There is a very high possibility that my life will end in suicide, if not now then a couple years or a decade later.

For now I could leave my home but I will have no job to do.

They don't understand how better it would be for my mental health and even studies and I can make real friends and I can finally live as myself if I transition right now. If I transition later I won't have any method of making new friends if the old ones are transphobic.

I'm going to a psychologist on Sunday, she doesn't know anything about being trans I think she thought I was saying I am intersex. I don't know if I can get to her, I hope I can.

Title,"I don't remember much of my childhood aside from the traumatic events that took place during high school. I was different, enjoyed theatre, musicals, sewing and cooking.

As a male in the late 90's and early 00's, that was enough. But put towards the fact that I was brought up to stand up for what is right, and what wasn't. I stood up to my bullies. This lead to daily beatings and emotional persecution. 

The worst happened when I was knocked unconscious with a bat. I was placed in the schools sick bay, unattended until I woke up to my mother and grandfather. We changed schools, but it was too late. The straight A student was gone, and I would do and mask anything to fit in.

I learnt how to be a 'man' from my peers. I'd lost interest in everything before, and found refuge in PC gaming. This became my life of escape, for 20 years. I held jobs down at a time for 3 years at most, with more time off work in-between finding work again.

Who I was became lost and muddied, I withdrew from family. My parents divorced. My grandparents passed. I'd attempted suicide a number of times, unsuccessfully. I'd tried the route of medication. Never found, trusted or openly spoke to professionals who always seemed, disinterested and that my tribulations were simplistic and unworthy of anything more than the top 10 recommendations for depression treatment seemingly starting with how to for dummies. To be honest, I don't trust, nor like people at all. And the professionals are people.

Cowardice, don't do it for you loved ones and the impact it will have on them, I'd heard it all. But at what point can I start living and loving life. When all I did was live for them, deep down in my heart I know what I want. Living an empty life, vs ending it.

My fathers family hail from the UK, and he won't leave me to be with them. I have a friend, whom I met online some years ago. But in the 6 months of late, she is so worn down trying to help me and keep my head above water, it has permanently changed the happy go lucky woman she was. And I can't live with that anymore. I can't do what was done to me, intentional or not. I will not stand by and abide the burden I've become. My father, copped a lot of my abuse and hatred during my removal from society.

I tried again a few months ago to see a professional. All she could rule, was that I am now agoraphobic, chronic anxiety and wanted me to go on medication again. Medication tuned me out and turned me into an apathetic zombie. I won't do that again. 

I no longer feel connected to any part of society. I no longer feel love, or loved. I only see an abyss, which I belong in. If I could trade my life for someone else's, I would.

I've yearned for peace, and an escape from the prison and hell that is my mind for decades. I'm no longer capable of fighting this, and truth be told, I don't want to.

*Nietzsche said the bravest thing a man can do is to gather his loved ones around him and take his own life before time and disease have a chance to lay him waste. If one cannot live ferociously, why live? The only real question is: Should we wait until life has proven to us how disappointing it is? Or should we cheerfully charge toward whatever awaits us on the other side of death, presuming it cannot be worse than this? If one studies the rich and successful one cannot help recognizing their path leads not to happiness. But apologies to those who will miss me. Wouldn't you rather see me free-falling among the stars than chained to a life which only evokes my disdain or even worse, my apathy?*

I wish I could come up with something heartfelt, original and inspirational. My mind is clouded with thoughts of escape, and nothing else. I'm too far gone, and I'm at peace with that. There is just one thing left to do.

Im sick of everything.,"Im sick of everything.

My entire life is going downhill since i started highschool. Im getting bad grades in all of my classes and im constantly being made fun of by my family for being in modified classes and every day im being built up just to get teared down by my parents. Just today I was trying to talk to my mom about my health which was a stupid idea by a stupid person my mom is emotionally and sometimes physically abusive i was talking to her about how im overweight and if i should go to the gym since im 13. And she starts screaming at me about how i have no confidence and im useless and has told me to go and die multiple times and i go to school thinking it will be an escape from home but boy was i mistaken at school im made fun of for being stupid and dumb. I came home today with bruises but haven't told anyone. ive started saving up money to move out when im 16. But its getting unbearable sometimes i think my parents are getting better and nicer and i start to talk to them about myself and they call me ungrateful and tell me they wished i was never born and I have an older sister and they treat her like a princess and buy whatever she wants while i barely get the bare necessity's for school and to live. I dont know where im going to go when i move out and i know theyre going to try and stop me. On multiple occasions they made me think as if I was in the wrong and on top of that my dad screams at me daily for my grades but doesnt help me. I got a tutor and she is nice but my family is just trying to break me down and im sick of it. Im constantly in yelling matches with my parents until they hit me where i go into my room and I dont have any escapes from reality like videogames. I have my own laptop for school but when I get home its taken away unless i have homework. Even then im supervised everything i do. I only get out of the house when its for something theyre making me do or hell will happen they talk to me like im some sort of idiot I once had fractured two of my fingers on my dominant hand and they said i was faking and made do work until i was begging to be taken to the doctor until my fingers had swelled up so big i could barely move them. I have been made to do so much work for my sister as she is in their words ""The best child I could have ever wished for."" And frankly i just want to leave. And I have thought about suicide multiple times but I cant because i am a muslim and so is my family. I do not know what i am going to do when i turn 16 but i can just only hope for a new start. When i started highschool I thought it would be a fresh start for me but it was the complete opposite. I gained weight and was made fun of even my sports teacher has made fun of me multiple times. The only subject i liked was science because my science teacher was a nice women who actually liked me and i excelled in science but she soon changed teaching science to art and now im stuck with an old women who loves failing people and humiliating me specifically. Even on my 12th birthday nobody remembered while my sister got around 200$ airpods while the only gift i got was a singular cookie from coles by some girl in my math class.

Nothing feels worth anything anymore,"I can't anymore, I'm lost and am constantly miserable. Sure, I have a narcissistic parent. Sure, he ingrained the memory of him beating up our cat that I can't forget. Sure, he hit me so hard that it was hard to walk. But he doesn't directly insult me, he didn't beat me up, and I have no scars or bruises anymore. At least he's fed me my entire life and taken care of me. 

My life isn't that bad, I'm not poor, I do moderately at school, I have friends and an amazing sister and mom which I have the honour to say I'm related to. So many people have it worse than me so why is it that only now everything I've built up is crumbling in front of my very eyes and I can't do anything about it. The lies I've built up to protect myself are fucking me over because I can't maintain them anymore.

I've been cutting for the past three months, but it was only this month where I seemed to crack. I have no motivation for anything, showering, cleaning my room and getting out of bed seem like impossible tasks. The same thoughts of being worthless, useless, dumb, ugly, not enough, a waste, a burden and so much more keeps repeating in my head constantly. I can't feel angry at anything anymore and I have only been able to cry like 3 times this past month despite feeling on the verge of tears and a horrible sadness that seems to completely eat me from the inside constantly. I've only been able to sleep this past week cos of this disgust of food that suddenly emerged this past week despite me using overeating as a coping strategy my entire life.

If I'm an ungrateful piece of shit that can't even value the moderately good life I have and the amazing people around me then why am I still living?

For how much longer will I have to wish I hadn't lived through the day before I go to sleep and wish id died in my sleep in the morning? For how much longer will I continue having these thoughts constantly? For how much longer will I have to tell myself ""just one more day""? why? why one more day? why do I have to live another day? why does every day feel worse than the last? I literally do nothing all day, I'm completely useless. I'm honestly just waiting for my next attempt to be successful and don't even know why Im posting this in the first place.",CertifiedSewerRat,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oudsyy/nothing_feels_worth_anything_anymore/

I'm sick of always needing to be the one there with no one behind me,"I'm always the person to go to my friends and try to convince them life is worth living; I am always there for anyone who needs help but there is just no one there for me. When I open up about my suicial thoughts all I get is ""if you kill yourself I'm not coming to your funeral because its a sin and I willn't morn your death"" ""You won't do it, you've tried and it never works"".

If they only knew,"If they only knew. If they knew how bad it is and how much it hurts what would they do? Who would care? Would they do anything because it would be the right thing to do and socially unacceptable to do nothing? Or would they do anything because they actually truly care? How many people do I know that actually care? That care more than just a ""that's aweful"", ""she was cool we'll miss her"", or would truly cry and mourn for more than a week at most? 3? Maybe 4? I have no one to go to because I am constantly afraid of bothering people no matter what they say. Why? Why do I care so much about bothering people? Because I don't want to lose them. Friends are so hard to come by for me that I will do anything to keep from losing them, and by doing that I push them away. All of my friends leaving me has been my fault, my own undoing. I am always so afraid, terrified, of losing them that I will never text or call them because I don't want to bother them. But I do anyways. I am a burden on so many. Even when I desperately need someone, even when my own life may depend on it, I do nothing because I don't want to bother anyone. I am becoming the boy who cried wolf, saying it so many times that people stopped believing it. It's no longer as serious as it once was, now it's an attention grabber, something I just say to make others feel sorry for me. If they only knew. But who is ""they"" anyways? I have no one to go to, no one that truly cares, I am alone. 

What am I doing with my life? Nothing meaningful. I can't keep a job for more than 2 years without getting bored and quitting. And I decided to go to college?  As if that would fix anything. I will graduate, get my degree, get a job, and get bored within 2 years and quit. My degree wasted, thousands of dollars in debt. That is of course assuming I don't get bored with college and drop out first. I have become the very thing I was terrified of becoming and tried so hard to avoid. I am nothing, I am worthless, I am contributing nothing useful to anyone. How do I tell them? How do I ask for help? There is no way, I have no one. I am alone. If they only knew, who would come? If any? What would they say if they only knew?

I don't think I can do this anymore,"I'm 17, things have just been so unbearable for the past few months. my first boyfriend who was genuinely a gem and who I loved so much left me and not even 2 weeks after found someone else. I still talk to him and he insists I'm still the most wonderful person he's met but it's breaking me apart having to think about all this shit so much. I could cut contact with him but it's too hard to decide. I wish he was a piece of shit and I wish I could hate him but he wants to try to help and it's tearing me apart. I've been so close to suicide too many times in the past couple of months too, and I've been self harming, not too severely but regularly.

it also doesn't help that I lost most of my friends while I went up into sixth form. I've been sat in silence through most of it and I haven't been in since early June because of how far from functional I am. 

my parents love me and are trying their best to help me but we can't get anything done. counselling hasn't been particularly useful and it's going to take months to get the chance for a diagnosis or antidepressants. my dad lost his job so I don't want to be a financial burden also in these hard times.

I feel so ungrateful because I've had nothing particularly traumatic happen, but I just can't seem to find any reason to live. I'll have good moments but it drops so far back every time after. I didn't sleep last night. I can't get comfortable and I just feel so close to finally running away and killing myself I feel like I should just do it.

evidently I'm suffering with some kind of mental illness. I haven't been diagnosed with anything so I'm unsure as to what but I get so fucking scared so constantly that everyone I love will leave me. ever since I was maybe 5 or 6, friends have left me and it's affected me more than I feel it does with others. when I was around 9, my only friend left me and I stood crying in the kitchen with a knife clutched to my chest. I didn't do anything but I wanted to die. I've had so many friends just turn on me or leave and now my relationship with someone who I trusted and adored so much failed because of my stupid fucking mental state. he found it stressful because he wanted to make me feel better but couldn't, and because of the distance which obviously contributed to both of our struggles and I just feel like such a burden to everyone. I suppose it's ""good"" that it's over because it obviously wasn't healthy but I just want to kill myself. I feel completely unlovable and it hurts so much how quickly I was replaced. but he's still here for me and it's so hard to know what to do.

I don't know if I believe I'll ever allow myself to love anyone like that again. and I'm scared to trust anyone even more than ever. but that just makes it so hard to justify continuing living. 

I have supportive people around me and I know I do but I just want the agony to stop. and I don't want to burden anyone. nobody will worry about me if I'm dead. I understand that ""it can get better"" and ""lots of people get out of it"" but lots of people also don't. I'm terrified. I have the whole summer ahead of me and at most 2 people who would do anything with me. I don't think I'm going to make it to 18. I don't really want to make it to 18. 

it's all too much. at this point the only thing stopping me from killing myself is the fact that 95% of suicides are unsuccessful. but I've been in so much agony that I'd rather have taken physical pain. I'm just sick of being alive and I can't even be awake or asleep without thinking of killing myself. so many graphic images of what I could do cross my mind and it's overwhelming.",ASTM_F899_12,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oul8ns/i_dont_think_i_can_do_this_anymore/

I F(16) got sexually assaulted and there are people telling me I deserved it and should kill myself,"So it seems I can never escape this. So my friend told me to write about this. A while back I was at a park and my previous sexual assaulter (if that’s a word) from when I was a kid, grabbed me and put me over his middle console and hurt me. Maybe for an hour I have no idea.

I had a major panic attack and could not move at one point during it, and he took that opportunity to take pictures of me. Exposed. He taunted me and told me how “broken” I looked and he would lick up my stomach and when I’d cry he would take a picture of something and say “you’ve grown up so much and it kills me knowing no one else has touched you like this, in the future when a man touches you, you’ll only feel me, they won’t be able to touch the pain away” I will never forget it. As long as I live, I will remember that quote. I’ve never felt more disgusting.  He is put away. He can’t hurt me anymore, but the pictures he took do.

I wish that there was a clinic that I could get put down at. My body carried away in all cleanliness and efficiency. But no, if I want to do this I'm going to traumatize some poor stranger. I just want my body to be packed neatly away and not have to think about anything ever again. No funeral, just politely disposed of. I want peace.

I know I'm going to end up alone. I just know it,"Nobody is going to give a shit about me. I'll be 30 with nothing to my name. All conversations lead to nothing in the end and they never last long. I want to be wanted. To be snuggled up next to someone and not have to worry if I bother them at all. I wish I didn't have to imagine killing myself in different ways every night. I wish my brain would just shut off. I'd rather just be able to accept it now since its never going to get better.


I just wish I could feel like I'm accepted. That I'm valuable and that people would actually think of me sometimes. That I wasn't such a background character that I'm not even noticed unless I did something wrong. Why is suicide even wrong for someone in my case where I'm just wasting my life away anyway? Maybe if people gave a shit I'd have an actual reason to try. I've already tried and failed enough. I know my worth and my limits and I've already hit it. Everyday is meant to only remind me of that and make fun of me for it. Poetry was the last thing I loved and I can't bring myself to enjoy that anymore. I love making poems and shit for others but I don't feel like anything I do is enough and its just more ammo for people to shit on me for what I like and do.


Life is such a fucking tease and it isn't funny anymore. I can't keep acting like I'm okay and that I don't take thing too seriously because I do. I'm fragile and I should've never been born but yet here I am! Lmao its so so funny right? I want this to all be over. I find extreme comfort in a void existence, one that resembles the one I had back before I was birthed. To not even be able to sense or feel anything. To be completely numb with no thoughts or worries. The best resemblance to that is sleep but I find it hard to get into.

"feeling helpless, and so, so tired","i’ve been spiraling into this horrible depression for only a couple months but i already feel defeated. i have no desire to get clean from self harm, to feed myself, to do well in school, to maintain my friendships. my body feels painful to live in and my head shuts down often. im in too deep, even if i feel great tomorrow, i have no future in school, my relationships are ruined, and my body is so fucked up. everything i do is just to pass time. i feel like an animal that knows it’s about to die soon, curling up and accepting everything that happens here on out. i hate myself more than anything, not a day goes by where i don’t want to die.

And the worst part is i’m too scared to do it. I’m terrified of dying in pain and i wish someone else would do it for me, put me down like a dog. i just want to sleep. i want peace. i don’t know what to do anymore or how to get out of the ditch i’m in. Or even if i want to get out, i only ever feel this overwhelming sadness or apathy now.

I used to feel great, i genuinely thought i was perfect. A delirious self-confidence high happened just a few months ago, i loved feeling obsessed with myself and i don’t know what happened.

I'm scared to tell people who are close to me about it, because when I think about their problems mine feel so miniscule, yet I can't escape the thoughts of dying.

My partner of 4 years left me and it's been 5 years since then, I think about them all the time and can't handle the thought of bringing anyone else into my life. I changed my circle of friends a lot, I can't commit, I distance myself and leave people who for some reason like me and try to keep me close and then feel shitty when new people don't really care about me. I've been to therapy and abandoned my treatment 3 times.

I'm afraid I'm stuck with a life I'm miserable in,"Towards the end of 2017, I was fired from my job for what I view was a personal conflict with my boss and while I took it hard, I was able to bounce back pretty quickly. I also bought a van and traveled across the country for about 4-6 weeks. 

For the next couple of years, I continued to travel during the winters for 6 weeks or so at a time and can say without a doubt that I never felt more present, alive and happy. I bought a pickup truck and built a bed in the back and traveled all over the US and Baja with my dog. 

At the end of 2019, I quit an ongoing freelance role I had to take on a different freelance role which paid more but was less fulfilling and more corporate. I didn't enjoy it at all and started it as I was preparing for another winter of travels. About halfway through my contract (which was supposed to just be three months) I basically stopped doing the work and stopped communicating. That was in mid-January 2020.

Little did I know what was around the corner... by the time COVID hit, I didn't have any steady freelance work and I never would have assumed that the government would offer unemployment to self employed people and freelancers, so I ended up taking a job as a delivery driver for Amazon. I had been talking with a friend about listing my house for sale by March, but by then, it seemed like the whole world came to a stop and we didn't go through with listing my house. 

Not only was I judged poorly by people in my professional world for being perceived as back-sliding in my personal and professional life, but taking that job ended up screwing up my unemployment benefits. I was eventual approved for the pandemic unemployment assistance program and could have been making $800/week on unemployment and traveling during that time and having the best time of my life, instead, I took a wage job and was miserable.

Then in July of last year, I got my girlfriend pregnant... 4 weeks after we first met. I didn't feel capable and confident considering my depression, my wavering commitment to a career, the fact that I was not even making enough money to support myself and a child, and so on. We talked about getting an abortion, but we bailed on our Planned Parenthood appointment at the last minute. I felt like if we went through with it, I would finally actually commit to selling my house for good this time and then go travel full time and be happy. I had actually purchased a van I planned to convert into a little DIY RV right before her and I met. 

Then even more... a side project I started with two other people two years ago was taking off, and I was doing the same thing... flaking out, losing interest, struggling with depression and money. Eventually, last summer as I'm driving an Amazon van, they started taking on new work without telling me. In January, they formed an LLC and rented an office space and didn't even tell me until after they did it. I haven't communicated with either of them in the last several months. 

Fast forward to now... I sold my project van in February and said that I was giving up that dream. I cycled through a couple other jobs over the winter,  but did end up getting another salaried job where I'm more or less back up to where I should be financially. And then we had our baby in March, just four weeks after I started the new job. She's very sweet and incredibly beautiful. We get comments and compliments all the time about how beautiful she is. I felt like after we had decided to go through with having the baby, I'd finally ""man up"" and shack up with my girlfriend and commit to being a family man. That didn't happen. We broke up in May and have been co-parenting since. 

Right now I'm in nowhere Montana staying in a yurt for a week while baby and her mom are back home. I started writing this post around 5:30 a.m. local time as the sun started rising. My boss (who is amazing and one of the kindest, nicest bosses I've ever had) is letting me take the time for a working vacation, so I'm only working half days and then go out hiking or exploring. I'm finally enjoying myself again after a year of acute and dangerous depression and I'm not sure I even want to go home. There's a part of me that's thinking maybe I should just ""disappear"" and turn my back on my life back in Chicago. But all I know right now is that I regret not following my intuition and my heart by selling my house, committing to freelance work, getting unemployment and then starting a new life of adventure and fulfillment on the road. 

It's really hard... I don't want to abandon my daughter but I know that as soon as I get back home, I'm going to feel depressed and miserable again. I just wish so badly that I had followed my heart and left Chicago and my friends and colleagues on good terms when I had the chance, instead, I stayed and floundered and lost friends, lost career opportunities, went into debt, started a family I wasn't prepared for, and suppressed my dreams and my heart even more.

I’ve been going weeks at a time without leaving my house because I feel like around every corner is someone with a gun. I hate this feeling of being a prisoner in my own home. As fucked up as it sounds, I miss being suicidal. At least then I was fearless. I had no problem doing reckless behaviors. I could go on long hikes in the wilderness without fear of getting lost or needing a rescue. I figured if I died of starvation, oh well. At least I died having an adventure. But now I can’t even do the things that I enjoy. I’ve always had depression, but at least being suicidal meant I could walk out the door without the fear of death. If anything I welcomed it.

4th Month Without a Suicidal Thought,"November to late March was one of the worst points of my life. School was so hard, trauma from quarentine was plaguing me, and I was working on top of it. I was burning out so badly. I started to curl up in my bed and wish I would fade away. Then I wanted to die. I felt like I deserved it. Every mistake I made seemed like further proof I shouldn't be here. Living was torment to me. I would have frequent intrusive thoughts of ways to end myself. 

I am fortunate enough to have friends who have fought through the same problems, and I knew there could be a way out. I found a new doctor and I was prescribed Wellbutrin. A few weeks after taking it, all of my suicidal thoughts went away. I haven't had any urge to off myself since.

Just know that sometimes the urge to commit suicide isn't from you. Your mind is made up of volatile chemicals, and that is ok. I realize that I was convinced into believing the voice in my head because of my brain chemistry. Of course there are many more factors that lead me to want to die.

Suicide advise for relief?,"Hi everyone. First of all, I want to say thanks to all people here who try to help whatever way is available for them. I was going through posts and comments for a while and the community here seems to be great, so I've decided to trust my situation to you all. Before I make the post title more clear, here is a little background to it:

I'm having thoughts of suicide for last 3-4 years and so far I can't get rid of them permanently. Sometimes there are bursts of life which keep me up for a week or two, but eventually it all gets back there. I was unhappy in any of my recent relationships, because I feel incapable of actually loving someone. I live in the EU as a 3rd world country citizen doing whatever legal jobs that get me visa, so I won't be sent back to my unbearable shithole. 

At some point I started feeling that I'm tired of it all and want to quit, but I don't want to do it in a way that it will be very painful or that I'll make lots of people around witness something horrible(jumping onto a railway or something). So I came across the suicide bag, which seems to be the perfect way, and designed one for myself with an oxygen mask to make it more efficient. What I've mentioned though, is that when I realized that I have a ""Plan B"" for my life, I started living it kind of more to the max. I visited a bunch of concerts, did some random trips, booked a flight to Iceland and started throwing money out for things I like, which I wouldn't normally do.

However, when I found out about the suicide bag, I read some studies about it and found one from a Swiss clinic which legally provides assisted suicide. They were experimenting with helium through a device very similar to what I've got and reported that people go unconscious within 1 minute, but then actual death time may vary quite a lot from 7 to 30-40 minutes, what results in different oxygen intake. I was trying to find info about how much oxygen I may need for this, but couldn't find any resource so far. 

So, this leads to a question I had in mind, or maybe even two: where can I find some estimates on how much helium I may need for this and how to properly secure a tube to the helium tank? I assume there might be some more precise instructions out there, but I couldn't find them. Knowing this would actually help me to enjoy my life even more, since I would always have my Plan B ready when shit will hit the fan.

When I hang out with friends, even when I feel happy, there’s always that lingering feeling in the back of my head that wishes I was dead. Sometimes I wonder if my friends like having me around. Would they even care if I died?
Honestly, if I were to peacefully die in my sleep, I wouldn’t really care. When I do things I usually like, it doesn’t make me feel the same happiness that it used to. 
I feel alone. Which is probably so stupid bc I’m surrounded by people who say they love and care about me and I love and care about them too. But I can’t help but feel like I’m nothing but a burden. It’s so funny because the moments where I know I can’t stand to be alone are the moments I push people away. Because who would want to be around someone who is so sad?

I just feel like me being gone would be a huge help to my family; it would significantly improve their lives.,"My family is below middle-class poor.  I've been in the process of applying to colleges and I managed to pass some pretty big schools. But turns out we couldn't afford any of them. Kinda bummed me out, especially because everything that I truly want to pursue that would make me happy is expensive. I love film, music, all of the arts, but as you may guess, that wouldn't be the best choice for me living in a third world country. 

I do get that we're still privileged in many ways, and that a lot of people have it much worse, but idk. I think it seems okay to just disappear, have all my belongings sold (honestly could earn a lot), and use that to sustain my family and help my siblings with their college. Also deducts my costs of living/college which saves a LOT. 

People would be sad, but I would make sure to write letters, take videos, and maybe make a song or two. I would make sure that everyone knows it's no one's fault. 

I apologize if this seems weird or not serious. There are lots of people on this subreddit who are truly in dark places, so I apologize if this is wrong. I don't even think I'm totally suicidal, but the benefits of this just seems like something to consider.

Late night thoughts.,"I actually dislike my brain so much. 

For what feels like all of my life I’ve been in a constant battle with it. Between being hurt and torn down by people who I thought loved/cared for me, sticking up for myself by telling them to fuck off or removing them from my life. And picking up the pieces they smashed down and out of me. 

I was in an abusive relationship for 5 years. I got at first mentally abused and cheated on. Being made to be my fault he did these. Then the physical happened. It started with ya plate being thrown at me in an argument. It cracked on my head and I was bleeding and on the floor. He came over and kicked me. I have a bad kidney, and he knew that. And kicked me 3 times hard, in the left side of my bad kidney. Then took me to hospital saying I fell down the stairs. After he apologized and said he didn’t mean it. And I had hurt my head and don’t remember what actually happened. It’s painful for me to write this. But after more attacks like that, I started to wish he would just kill me. I felt nothing. I was not a human. I was simply there to be beat. 

To going to me, being those people to myself. Me, telling myself I’m not good enough, I’m fat, I’m ugly, I’m unloveable, I’m a waste of life etc. 

Now at almost 30, I’ve slowly started trying to be nicer to myself. Spending time outside. Actually going to therapy, taking meds, trying to talk nicely to myself. Accepting that I am actually not all of these things I’ve told myself. 

But my brain is so switchy. And most nights I find myself lying in bed, unable to sleep, hating myself. Wishing I could die. I just don’t understand why i am still alive. 

I don’t think anyone really wants me around. I try and make people happy, but I always end up feeling worse about myself and just wishing I wasn’t such a fuck up and try hard. No one loves me or cares. 

I just don’t want to try anymore. It’s easier and makes so much more sense to just give into the bad brain talk and die.",Kathrynrachelwilson,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ouee4k/late_night_thoughts/

Pregnant and not getting any better,"Hi,
I’m in my first trimester and have been feeling like I don’t want to be here anymore. I started therapy weeks ago as well as Zoloft and I am still in the same box I was when I began to get help. I am a stay at home mom with one vehicle my husband takes to work everyday and we just got denied food stamps. My world is pouring rain all around me, I keep trying to find a light at the end of this gloomy tunnel but I can’t ever seem to find one. I am happy we are pregnant, bc I have prayed for this baby but I also feel shame because I am so utterly depressed and anxious. No one understands me. I am literally a burden. I can’t even get a job to help with money bc my anxiety is so bad I freak out and have panick attacks before I start like a pos. The only thing I can do is take care of my toddler and attempt to clean this house I’m stuck in everyday. I have no interests in anything. Sure I could leave but I have no friends or anywhere to go. I just want a hotel to get away to but I can’t even do that bc we live paycheck to paycheck. I have nothing of my own.. I’m so low right now I don’t know if I could even get back up. I can’t kill myself bc there’s a baby inside of me. But I have been thinking about cutting to relieve the pain, that helped as a teen but I hate the scars now. Therapy hasn’t been helping very much either. I’m just so fucked off there’s no helping me. Just thought I could vent here since everyone around me is sick of the suicide jokes. Anyways, I hope you don’t feel sorry for me and I hope you have joy and love in your life where you never feel this isolated and alone.",ChanceExisting6239,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ou9cps/pregnant_and_not_getting_any_better/
Finally free to go,"I spent a year and a half slowly and methodically pushing away the love of my life because I knew it was inevitable. After all this time and a ton of tears I finally got confirmation that my absence won't completely destroy her. Shit, it probably won't even hurt if she ever found out. Pretty ironic that this is the one thing I was ever able to do successfully.( Never abused her or cheated. Couldn't bring myself to it. Just invented things about myself to push her away and made her think I didn't love her.) 

Point is, now that I can go the feeling is so damn nice. I don't feel like I have to be here anymore, I'm no longer tied to this daily cycle of pain. 

She's happy, hates me and I'm free to go.

Seeking advice or books on managing anger/hatred/ptsd/depression. Ty,"Hey there I'm a 27F have been living with my boyfriend for a year now. Ive been through my own kind of depression from suffering from a traumatic brain injury at 21. But i have healed. 

My boyfriend has been suffering all his life, seeing violence from his parents for the past 20 years towards each other. My boyfriend has been used and betrayed by prior partners and friends so he trusts and relies on no one. Hes distant from his older siblings because they ignored the problems in the household and left elsewhere leaving him with 2 violent parents. He suffers from ptsd, and is constantly annoyed and angry. He hates his family and hates his recently deceased father for all the abuse and drinking his father chose. My boyfriend hates life, does not enjoy it, everyday he suffers gets headaches and gets angry. Everthing irritates him, drivers, ppl, wasps, shopping, summer, cooking, even games. He remembers his past clearly and is in constant pain from grieving his brother. His brother died because his patents are inept at emetional understanding. His brother sought love from women, love he didnt experience at home; same goes for my boyfriend. His brother was the only one who understood what my boyfriend feels. My boyfriend has no motivation, and little things irritates him ruining his whole day. He distracts himself with games and excercise, but is in constant anger.

Ive been talking and dating him online for 5 years prior to me living with him. I thought what he needed was a decent partner who would care, comfort, and love him. But that doesnt cure what he feels. His emotions get out of hand becoming irritated, angry, violent and suicidal. I try my best to spend time with him, talk to him, listen, but half the time even me being around irritates him. Its hard seeing him suffer night n day, and it stresses me sometimes into inner tears. 

For me all ive ever been good at is self reflection and studying. I grew up poor but with a good mom. I was doing well at college in engineering prior to my head injury. My emotions and depression solved thmselves with self love and i healed. But he is different, no amount of care or comforting can make him feel better. I cook, clean, massage, coddle, support, and listen to him everyday. But that isnt what he needs. I dont know how to help him. He is also reluctant to apply for health insurance for therapy. I love him, and i want to be useful, i was hoping someone knows what hatred is like. What grief is like, what depression is like. Because i dont understand it. And i was hoping someone would reccomend me literature than can give true therapy for the irritation/ anger he feels. 

It would be upsetting if my post was removed, but thankyou for anyone who comments with book suggestions or has decent advice. At anypoint mine and his live could end tragically, I just want him to be okay even if he doesnt want me anymore.

"There is nothing horribly wrong with my life, I just want to die."," I am 25F, not american. I am using a throwaway because this is embarrassing to talk about. 

I think that, in general, I have a good life and I just feel so ungrateful for always thinking about dying. I think everything started while I was in university because I just HATE the career path I chose. I had to finish my major because I was too scared to change and now I just feel stuck.

I struggled for two years to get a proper job. No matter how hard I tried, I always bombed the interviews. Having 200+ negative interviews really made me feel worthless and I just can’t forgive myself for being so incredibly inept. I feel like I have nothing to contribute to this world because everything I do seems to go wrong.

However, my family always supported me (They actually care about me). Even though I didn’t have my own money, I never struggled financially thanks to them. My brother actually realized that I was in a really dark place and he offered to pay for my therapy sessions. Therapy helps.

Also, just to clarify, my family is not rich, we live a normal life. I don’t live surrounded by luxury, but I never lacked a bed or food. I guess my life is good and average. 

After all this time I just got a job and now I am supposed to be happy? I thought that getting a job would actually make my life better, but I feel the same. I also hate the job, I work too many hours and I can’t even afford my rent with the pay. So, at 25yo my family STILL pays for my rent. I know that I am supposed to be grateful to have such an amazing family that supports me, but I just feel like a burden at this point. I see so many 18yo with no studies or preparation becoming millionaires on the internet that I can’t help but feel like a waste of air.

I feel stupid and whortless and I feel like somehow I am going to get fired and I’ll just go back to doing… nothing? To be clear, I am not a lazy person, I hate not having anything to do, but I feel that I am incapable of doing things right, so I am incredibly scared of new challenges. So, in the end, I just don’t want to do anything. That’s when I start thinking about dying.

I know I don’t have the courage to kill myself, but I just want to die. I don’t want to try to be better, I want to stop. I talked to my therapist about this and he says that he is not worried about me because he knows I won’t commit suicide and... I kinda agree. But I just can’t stop thinking about it.

Everywhere I go I think of possible ways of killing myself. ALL THE TIME. Even if I am in a good mood, I just can’t seem to stop thinking about it. I am not going to say any details because I know that there are vulnerable people here looking for ideas, but I do have a lot of ideas. I also think about how easy it would be if I just were in a freak accident where I could die and my family wouldn’t suffer as much. I hate typing this, but I have even wished I had cancer and just die. I feel horrible for this.

I feel like I have nothing to live for. I am not a successful person. I hate my career path. I don’t want to get married nor have kids. I loathe the idea of being in a relationship. I don’t look forward to the future. I don’t even look forward to death because I have no faith, I don’t believe in any god nor religion. I think this is just it. The only reason I wake up every morning at this point is because of my mom. I love my mom and I just couldn’t cause her the pain of losing a child. At this point I think that the day that my mom dies, I will actually get the courage to kill myself.

The only really “bad” thing that has happened to me was that my dad was an alcoholic. He definitely damaged me as a kid, but whenever I think about dying, I never think of him.

I don’t really know if I am suicidal, because I don’t think I will actually try to kill myself right now, but I just wish I could stop thinking about it. It really makes me feel horrible and ungrateful. I know that (if they reach this point) a lot of people are just going to say that I have to “grow up” because I have a “good” life and a family that loves me. I agree, but I can’t do it. I just want everything to stop.

I know this was a long read, so if you are still here, thank you. I am writing this because I hope that sharing my experience with someone will help me to not feel so lonely. Also, because of my new job I moved to a new city and I just feel very lonely and scared in general.

"Ready to die, here’s why, please help, I’m desperate.","Recently a u haul with everything I own was stolen while I was moving. It’s the worst feeling I can remember in my whole life. 


Anyways earlier today I was talking to my dad and he was lashing out at me for every little thing because he was stressed about his shop business or something related. 

I asked him why he’s treating me that way and responding in such an angry way and he started screaming and threatening to hang up the phone. 

I started crying and begging him to stop and so he did hang up the phone which basically floored me for the whole day unable to enjoy anything. This is on top of everything I own getting stolen. 

I tried calling him later and asking him
To please apologize and he started saying, “If you say I was being mean, then I apologize” but I told him that’s not an apology that really would make me feel better and he jumped all over me again and told me he would hang up on me or leave the phone and let me talk to myself. 

And so he did, and I cried and cried and before writing this I was considering suicide. My mom is even more cruel than my father and so I always thought I could rely on him but him taking this route makes me feel I’m all alone in the world and want to die.

Friends?,"I have no friends. I am a 20 year old girl who is about to go into her senior year of college and it feels like I have nobody. 

I had a large group of friends my freshman year, but the summer going into my sophomore year they all ditched me but continued to hang out together. I’d try to approach them in class or at the dining hall but they’d never want to have a conversation. I even went to Europe with one of the girls. I wish I knew what I did wrong. 

I had a friend who was my best friend since we were 10. I messaged her asking to hang out a few times but she will either ditch me or just leave me on read. I decided to just leave her on her own and if she wants to see me, she can reach out herself. She never reached out. Again, I wish I knew why. I love spending time with her, it hurts. No one ever tells me things, they just leave without a word. 

I met this one girl online and we were going to meet up. I was excited to finally have fun for the first time in almost a year. I even told my mom and she was proud of me. The girl ended up ditching me. I sent a message a week later to see if she’d be down to try and again and I was left on read. 

I don’t know what to do. I constantly google how to make friends. I play video games online so it actually feels like I’m having fun with other people. I used to go out drinking and partying with my girls, and now I just drink alone on the couch to mask the sadness. 

Something must be wrong with me. This many people leaving isn’t a coincidence. I have decent social skills and I’m conventionally attractive, so it’s just my personality, the only thing I can’t change. Life isn’t worth it.",emixie,14,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ougwn7/friends/

I Loathe Myself,"I absolutely hate myself.

This is not an exaggeration. There's nothing that I find remotely redeemable about myself and quite frankly I'm tired of it all. I want to kill myself, plain and simple.

I've talked to my mom about it and she keeps sarcastically encouraging me to do it. But the thing is, I might just take her word for it because I cannot do any of this anymore. 

I'm absolutely hideous, obese, nearly balding with multitudes of health issues, all at fucking eighteen years of age and I'm so ashamed of being trapped within my body. I hate myself so much, I can feel the revulsion deeply embedded within myself show up every glance I take at the mirror.

I'm so fucking ugly, I don't deserve to live.

Why am I this way?

I'm academically very stupid and my skills at everything are very lacking. Even for the major that I plan on taking, I don't have any fucking skills. My dream college rejected me and my friends all hate me (maybe only a little lesser than I do myself). 

My dad is emotionally abusive and mom is toxic as well as blackmails me every chance she gets. Everyone around me loves to pick on my appearance and weight and I despise my existence with every fibre of my being and have numerous cuts all over my body to attest to that.

The only reason I haven't done it yet is because I was afraid of accidentally surviving it, but I've come to realise that anything and everything is better than my existence. I'm not afraid anymore, I think.

You'll probably never hear from me again, this may be the last post I ever write. Not like me leaving will even make the slightest of difference anywhere but pain will be stop being the only thing I feel. That's the only thing that sounds appealing to me right now.

Yah know help sounds bland after being told so many times,"Yeh yeh irl help / professional help would help but like compared to death they seem painfully temporary and something that is more of a gamble being sold as a promise. Like lots of it is fear and anxiety but i see it simply because of my current situation and my current views of the mental health system i believe getting irl help is a gamble. Im trying to survive! Im trying to get myself from waking up to falling back asleep without killing myself or hurting myself or accidentally hurting others. Do you not understand how hard that is? I dont need to gamble things getting better or worse when im barely fucking surviving! I cant fucking risk it. Sure things can get better after what month's potentially years of work and countless hours in therapy and other appointments. Fucking hell these people who tell me to get help fail to understand that my phone as pathetic and as cringy as it sounds has been whats keeping me going and keeping me alive. Its my only portal to something i can call a fucking social life. I lose that and im dead im not surviving shit. Im afraid of losing a life raft. And i seriously think that geting irl help potentially might mean loosing this portal. Between my mom whos seems more bent on why im happy than if im happy [don't worry i believe she loves me tho idk] and the fact i could be hospitalized and lose access to my phone. But like the other fact is the system is fucked theres lot of shit wrong with the system. A good therapist or hell any mental health professional can make things so much better but a bad one can make things dramatical worse. And if things get worse idk if i can make it out of my battles alive.  Theres at best a 50/50 chance on getting a good therapist or bad one. And don't get me started on being hospitalized. The point is i get irl help 50/50 chance i get better or die or i dont and i have a 50/50 chance i get better or die. Fucking hell i probably dont make any sense.

Adulthood is Terrifying,"I'm about to enter my senior year of college.

I'm terrified of what comes next.

I'm graduating with a music degree, but I want to become a 911 dispatcher. Genuinely, I want this job and I would feel fulfilled doing it. This isn't a goal I'm going for because I ""have to"". But there's so much more to surviving as an adult than just getting a job, y'know?

I'm going to have a lot of debt because I go to an expensive private college. When I picture the future all I can see is me, all alone, somewhere I don't know, not making any friends, being far away from everyone I love. I can't stay in my hometown (there's nothing for me here and it'd suck to live with my parents past college, though I do love them). I'm terrified I'm going to just be entirely and utterly alone.

And I don't know how I'm going to figure out the other adult stuff.

And I don't know if I am going to manage to survive.

The average salary for a 911 dispatcher lines up perfectly with what my mom said I'd probably need to make between rent, a car, expenses, and paying off loans, so I should feel better, right?

I don't have a car and that terrifies me. My parents can't afford to buy me one. I've had a disproportionate amount of friends whose parents/grandparents bought them/handed down a car. I'm scared I won't be able to afford one. I haven't been able to find a good school year job, just summer stuff. I'm hoping this year I can get something. But I don't think it's likely.

I was also just looking at a syllabus for one of my classes. I do well enough at school but it's always been a struggle to keep up because I coasted for years. I have a sinking feeling that it'll all just be the same this year.

I can't help but think my only viable option is to not live anymore.

Cults. Aren't I just the right person to join a cult?,"I have been spending the entire day listening to podcasts about cults like Aum Shinrikyo and Jonestown and such similar cases.

I seem like just the right person to become victim to one of these organizations. Yet I would be concious about the whole thing, and not be able to do anything but obey. Because such a thing would be really poetic. There is something really beautiful about dying for something with such conviction, yet the thing with the mass suicide in Jonestown disturbed me so I'm not all gone.

I'm not fully human. I'm concious but I'm kind of an automaton. I have noticed the more time I spend away from people the worse I get. When I spend a few hours socially interacting I become my optimal snappy normal autonomous self, even though I'm really and introvert. 

But i have been partially isolated for months now and I'm in a trance like state. Its all haze and confusing. I take so long to answer questions. I cant al most focus on more than one tought. my grammar as you can see its terrible and going back to fix mistakes is sooo tiring. so mentally taxing.

I find myself pacing in my room for literal HOURS. Its getting worse, I would do this as a kid too but its getting worse. I pace back and forth. I suspect I have some kind of autism bu th but I only have some symptoms. it doesnt matter though Im never going to get diagnosed.

I need help,"   I don't even know where to start this. My mom's an alcoholic abusive fuck who constantly blames me for ruining her life and how she should've went through with the abortion when she's hammered, and when she's sober she constantly calls me an embarrassment and how she wants me gone. No matter how calmly I speak how nice I am she just rips me apart everytime I don't wanna do anything but lock myself in my room 24/7


  I'm trapped in some traumatic bond of a relationship, I'm constantly fucking manipulated and gaslighted, I'm ready to take my life so I turn to them for help and they just laughed in my face basically. That's what love is right. The person I love with all my heart doesn't give a fuck if I die. They're just keeping me around until they find a replacement, that's happened before so I know. I can't leave tho, I wanna be with them. I don't wanna be constantly hurting but I can't imagine life without them. I live in some false reality where I pretend their personality is what I want and not the abusive shit it is. We're currently long distance so it's really easy to just slip away in this daydream we're the perfect couple.


  I have no friends. No acquaintances or anything. Everyone I talked to in highschool stopped talking to me, i have social anxiety so trying to put myself out this is a no. I'm so fucking lonely I don't leave my house, I never got to make those ""teenage"" memories with a best friend. I spent majority of my teenage years in my house alone. Even if I had social skills I'm such a fuck up I'm terrified when they see the real me they'll leave. 


  My mental health is gone. I'm so fucking unstable to the point I've been blacking out n throwing massive rage fits. I even got charged for vandalism since it happened in public once. I'm terrified, that isn't who I am I don't know who controls me when these happen I don't know what even triggers them to happen but afterwards I feel so guilty and judged I wanna fucking off myself I can't take it. 



  I've been screaming and begging for help, that I can't take it anymore but nobody listens. I don't know how to get help. I don't know who to ask where to go or anything. I will not do impatient treatment or go into a psych ward, mainly because I have two indoor cats and my mom always being drunk she leaves the door open sometimes. If I lose my cats that's the end of me, they're my only lifeline. 

  I've debated texting a suicide hotline number but I'm so scared they'll break confidentiality because I definitely am at high risk of hurting myself and/or taking my own life right now. The last thing I need is police banging on the door to throw me into a padded cell in the hospital. 

  No matter how optimistic I've been how hard I've been trying to pull myself out of this hole it blows up in my face. I spent 2yrs trying to turn it all around, and now it's at the worst it's ever been. I don't know what the future holds whenever I think it can't get worse it does and I can't take it anymore.


  Like I said my cats are my only reason I'm alive right now.  But today I've been having these fuck it all type thoughts where they don't matter. Nothing does. Once I'm gone all my memories are wiped away so I won't feel guilty I won't watch them from above n feel bad, I'll be gone. I'll not be suffering anymore, but that makes me feel so guilty it's overwhelming

I'm jist overwhelmed in general I'm sick to being curled up in my bed crying so hard I can't breathe, I'm sick of crying so much it makes me throw up. I haven't eaten anything in 4 days I'm just so fucking done I don't wanna feel like this anymore

I don't know where to go who to turn to July 27th marked a year since my last attempt and honestly I wish I wasn't so pathetic and failed. If I could do something right for once I wouldn't be here suffering. But I made the idiotic choice of ""oh it'll get better"" when it's gotten worse the last year.

My suicide note,"February 2021: 

5 years ago, I was diagnosed with OCD and depression. I've never recovered. I wish I could be happy and passionate about things as I used to be  

In those 5 years, I've finished off my undergraduate degree, ran long-distance races and done countless internships. On the contrary, my ex left me because I were mentally unstable and I've struggled to find a full-time job. 

If only I weren't slow at doing things during my internships (even though my performances were great). If only I wasn't slow whilst doing the dishes. If only my mental health issues weren't an obstacle. My ex would still be with me today and I would have had a fantastic gpa/grades. If only I wouldn't struggle whilst doing practice papers for the GRE or whilst writing my CV. If only I could brush my teeth twice a day and take a shower daily. If only I could lose weight and go on a diet. If only I were good at playing the piano or cooking and not below average. If only I could achieve my goals (let it be small or big). If only I were mentally well and happy. If only I could stop being arrogant after doing things. 

If only I had the courage to commit suicide because I want to end this miserable feeling. If only I could not wake up one morning. If only my prayers of a death wish were answered. 

A friend of mine from primary school passed away in a car crash last week. If only it were me and not him. If only I could be sent to prison for life for a crime I did not commit. If only I could stab myself in the head with the knife that is currently in my room. I want to end this shitty and miserable feeling. 

I am considering self-harming myself tonight. I am considering punching myself and using my knife. I can't take this anymore. If only I could explain to people the situation I am in. If only I could describe what I am feeling. I cried nunerous times before writing this post. I don't know if I've included everything. 

I hope by the time this post goes up I am no longer on this planet. Please something or someone kill me. I would be very grateful.",WydStepbroooooooooo,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oubqaq/my_suicide_note/
goodbye,😒,theowawayhs,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oueuey/goodbye/
So we are back to this again,"I wrote a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/ot7dhc/after_16_years_of_being_the_funny_kid_i_found/) previously about my suicidal mindset, my beliefs.

TLDR: my mom is extremely emotionally abusive, and manipulative.

I was born in Virginia US, and I lived there for 10 years. When I was 10 years old, my father died, cutting off our only source of income. My mom was capable of working, but she chose not to, because her father asked her to live in India where she would not have to work (my grandfather is stinking rich. He owns a half billion dollar company), and so my mom decided that instead of being independant with slightly smaller income, she would rather be dependant on my grandfather, and not work ever.

Something clearly short-circuited in her brain, the second we stepped foot on indian soil, she turned into a sadistic, gaslighting psychopath who would actively look for opportunities for blaming me for everything that goes wrong in her life.

I ignored this behavior for three fucking years, because I had figured that she was grieving for my father (we moved to india about a month after the death, and she was still processing). I figured that she would self-normalize, and everything would be back to normal in a few months

I could not have been more wrong. as the time passed, she got worse and worse.

Three fucking years of my life, I spent kissing her ass, and trying not to be a ""disappointment"".

Then one day, when she was hitting me with a wooden spatula, I decided that enough was enough. I am done taking this shit from her. Please note that At the time I was 5'11, and my mom was barely 5'4 and I was still taking beatings from her and not doing anything.

I raised fucking hell that day. She had hit me for the third or fourth time over something stupid, like spilled water, and I simply grabbed the spoon from her hand and snapped it in half, as though it were butter. I yelled until my fucking lungs felt like a meth-smoker who had overdosed 40 times in 3 seconds. I yelled at her about how she was taking out her issues on me, and how spilled water is nothing to hit people for. 

During this time, I still didnt mention the entire three years of abuse that I had endured. 

I didnt want to address something that I could not change. But i should have done it when I had the opportunity. 

Anyways. She took this reaction as an opportunity to say that I had ""behavioral issues"".

She promptly put me in therapy, thinking that it would change me to be her ideal fucking slave, who does everything he is told without questioning.

She put me in with a doctor that she knew, because she thought that she could manipulate her into telling me that I was the problem. 

this doctor was very professional however, and told my mom to leave the room. I didnt trust her at first, but then she told me that I was allowed to call the police if she ever told anyone what I told her in the session.

Lo and behold. the floodgates opened. 

SHe did a bunch of tests

lo and behold, within a month I had been diagnosed with extreme clinical depression, ADHD, Dyslexia, and a few other mental illnesses.

Once the diagnosis had been completed, She prescribed me some antidepressents, which my mother promptly refused to buy.

However, because the therapist took the money out of her fee, and bought me the meds. I was almost in tears. Here was someone who didint even truly know me, and she felt comfortable enough to take my meds out of her personal income. 

They didnt really help, and so she just started working on my mental health

The initial outburt that I had had (snapping the wooden spoon), released the floodgates and I started to really have behavioral issues.

I am currently 6'4, and I use that height to my advantage. I get in fights all the time, sometimes hoping the other person would win, because I just want physical pain to match the pain inside. I started self-harm, and cutting, and all sorts of other shit. I was a weed addict, alcoholic, and chainsmoker (by the age of 14), and I was just flat out ready to die. 

A bunch of great commentors on the above linked post, made me realize that I only need to survive for two more years in this house. I can kiss their ass until I finish college (I want to become a psychologist to help other people like me get through what they are going through), and when I finnaly get a job, Im going to cut contact",akhilachanta8,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ou58iw/so_we_are_back_to_this_again/

Euthanization,"Just planning ahead.

I'm in my early 20s, I'm antinatalist. Seems more dignified and logical to end my life in my own hands, though I'm still afraid to take the plunge. I'm scared of going to hell or having to repeat this life again.

I have no debts and I was smart, sometimes too smart for myself to actually enjoy this life. I've been so smart I've completed a good chunk of my life goals and I should be able to finish in a few decades. Around age 50. Maybe that's enough to get some sickness or accident. After that, I'm afraid I'll be so bored. Maybe I'll adopt children. Anything to stop the existential dread.

For now, I'll just try to play it smart and stay healthy.
But I'm already quite tired of feeling like this, the upswing of hedonism, only to feel like this again.

I live to finish my career goals, my new partner, ability to travel, interesting people. And then what? And then what... I don't know...I really hate this...",seeyouinbahala,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oubh17/euthanization/
I hit a wall,"I'm at a loss on what to do with my life. I'm on SSI, I'm stuck with nothing to do, no interest in doing anything and think about suicided on a daily bases. I have no plans, It's just that the thoughts are becoming more and more frequent.

I feel depressed and pissed off. I want to do things but my mind feels murky. It's extremely hard to learn new things, focus on anything or enjoy things I usually enjoy. Most day's I'm just hopping to get cancer so I don't have to worry about my future anymore.

I've been to therapy a lot. almost 10 years of on and off therapy. I'm on effxor, Lamotrigine and Buspirone. Only one that seemed to help things a bit was Lamotrigine but before I can even think about upping it I need to deal with my insurance which decided to change which my primary was as I was looking for a new therapist (Lucky fucking me right?).

On top of all of this, the future just seems bleak. Not just for me but for the world. I don't even have to look at the news to know shit's falling apart out there. Homeless seem to be a record numbers and people seem to be caring less for one another each year. The struggle is real and I'm at a loss on what to do with a lot of things. I'm one among millions that probably feel this way and each day thousands become a statistic.

Lastly, If we were created by some higher power I want to say. Fuck you God! Either give us a hand or go to the hell in which you created, you PoS!

I'm scared my boyfriend is going to die,"I have a long distance boyfriend. We met online and I can genuinely say he's made me a better person. He was nothing like I ever thought I would date before, very different but I think I needed someone like him. 

He has a lot of trauma and he wants to die a lot. He hurts himself a lot and I wish he didn't feel like he had to. We've argued before because of how he treats me sometimes -  moments where he had breakdowns and said really awful things to and about me. Because of this, after 5 months, I put boundaries in place to protect me and my mental health which feels hugely selfish (protecting myself when he already feels terrible) but he respected my boundaries and he started seeing a therapist (even though he hates them).

He's told me now that my boundaries make him feel awful and like he's the bad guy, I've made him feel like he isn't good enough - something i'd never want to do to anyone, especially him. I love him, more than I've ever loved anyone. He loves me, respects me, treats me well and makes me feel like the most beautiful girl in the world. He’s amazing. 

I've always been there to support him when he's struggling and talked him out of it so many times but he's so scared - scared i'm going to leave. I don't want him to be scared of me or because of me. I know he puts on a fake smile a lot of the time, especially with his friends and his job. He’s progressed in small ways and I’ve tried to help him in whatever way I can but I just don’t know how. I never say the right thing. I don't want him to die and it be because of me, I don't want to make him feel like he's not good enough, I don't want to lose him. I'm scared and I think in trying to protect myself I've made him so much worse. I just don't want him to die.

Why not add something more illicit to the mix as well, right? Plus they help me cope with life. But then at the same time I know I don’t want this new drug issue to become problematic which I can see happening due to my mental health, but at the same time I don’t feel like my substance is bad enough to warrant help?

The world as it is,"Every day, it gets worse, and it never gets better. There is something else that comes along with every smidgeon of progress that makes things 10 times worse and negates any sense of contentment or goodness that came with that improvement. Every time you take a stride forward, you take ten steps back.

Right now, I don't understand how anyone can look forward to the future. It's growing increasingly dystopian, with little a regular person can do to stop it. It's intolerable, and there's no way to stop it. A small number of people will foresee dangers and infringements on rights and freedoms that are occurring, but no one will listen, or will dismiss them as insane or impossible, and then when those things occur, people will rationalize it as a good thing, and you'll be insane for opposing it, and it will become the new normal.

I can't deal with all of the slick slopes, mental gymnastics, and fallacies that people seem to accept without question. I can't deal with the way the world is; I'm not okay with it and never will be, and there's no way for me to deal with it since I'm not designed the same way others are.

Life is indeed awful, and the only way out is to die.

I'm not sure if this is the way things have to be because it's human nature, or if it's simply the result of humans wanting to make each other's lives miserable when things could be so much better. I can't decide which is the worse.

None of this has helped me in any way. I need care and understanding, and there is none to be had. I have no family, most of them are dead. The person who abused me the most in my family is terminally ill and on her deathbed. I am incredibly alone, despararely in need of human connection and support due to my conditions, and absolutely no one cares.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I became ill with CFS, chronic pain, and IBS, I already suffered greatly from the abuse, as well as the autism I was born with. My difficulties with autism including significant speech issues and dyspraxia were dismissed and I did not receive an official diagnosis on my medical records until it was too late. Throughout my childhood I was mocked and treated like a failure by my teachers and peers, because I could not communicate properly.

&amp;#x200B;

Little did I know that hell would become worse when I ended up physically disabled. There truly is no compassion for the weak in this world. I do not qualify for benefits, and I cannot work full time. I hurt myself for many years trying to force myself to do things I was not able to, because no one believed me, and now I am permanently damaged. I can not walk long distances anymore and am in constant physical pain and exhaustion.

&amp;#x200B;

People act like it is my mindset that is the issue and not the way the world treats disabled people. I try to stay in education and get held to the same standards as an able bodied person. My partner resents me and acts like it is an extreme pain to put up with me because I am always ""complaining."" I rely on my partner for stability and shelter, and he threatens to yank that from me at any time.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet, I am still blamed for not loving my life. A life where I cannot do most of the things healthy young people can. A life where my vision is permanently disoriented, where I am always ill, dizzy, unable to eat what I want without pain, unable to move around too much, always malaised and ready to sleep again. 

&amp;#x200B;

A life where people don't truly believe I am ill because the disease is invisible. A life where I am gaslit about the severity of my pain constantly because I cannot function normally, nor can I jump through the hoops to beg the beurocrats for poverty level disability benefits because I have already been told I don't qualify under current rules.

&amp;#x200B;

No one understands and thinks I'm totally insane for wanting to die. I'm sure if they were subjected to a life where they could barely do what they enjoy, where no one believed their pain, where they were subjected to abuse and poverty simply for becoming ill through no fault of their own, they would not blame people like me for being suicidal.

&amp;#x200B;

Quality of life is far more important to me tha quantity. I hate how I am forced to suffer, being treated worse and worse everyday by the entire world. Yet I am not allowed to end my misery? 

&amp;#x200B;

No, I am not insane for acknowledging reality. It is not my mindset thats the issue. Therapy will not fix the dehabilitating physical pain that is DESTROYING me. Stop treating sick people like we choose to be in agony.

I will be leaving this world soon, because all of these blind, individualistic optimists genuinely expect a disabled person to function with no community support. They expect your family to care for you or you to struggle alone in isolation. I refuse to constantly battle the threat of homelessness and destitution. No more of this.",PM_ME_YOUR_TUTURUS,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ou9pij/sick_and_disabled_individuals_are_treated/
I'd rather die than work for the rest of my life,"I don't know how people can keep full time jobs. I've always had to job hop because I get incredibly overwhelmed and suicidal when I have to work for so long. 

You have no free time to do anything that you enjoy when working because your off days you have to play catch up on chores you missed during the week. You don't have the time to go see your loved ones and friends. You become so stressed that you lie in bed at night and get absolutely no sleep. You have no time to cook a healthy meal because you come home at night and you're so exhausted from the day. 

My anxiety, depression, panic attacks, and suicidal tendencies just start spiraling and I feel like I'm drowning. I'm expected to keep working because everything in life is so expensive. Why is life so expensive?

I’m a mother,"Ever since being a mother I have so many urges. I get so angry at my fiancé whether it’s him not taking the “right” pictures of me or he’s not cleaning right and I just get so angry and upset for so many small things. It’s been pushing us apart leaving me feeling alone and with this depression I’m so tired and I don’t play with my daughter and I find it harder and harder to get off the couch or take care of myself (I take care of her and feed and clothe and change her and she’s doing fine) I still feel like I’m failing her. I can’t look in the mirror anymore. I gained 100 pounds with my pregnancy with my daughter who is now a year old and I am now pregnant again and I’m due in three months. I feel like a failure of a mother and wife, I don’t leave the house for days. I don’t drive and we only have one car with no air conditioning and being so big and hot outside I don’t want to go outside anyways. Which is another thing I’m guilty about-not taking my daughter outside because she’s one and should have outside time. I don’t drive so it’s terribly hard to get to therapy. All of my friends live far away which I can’t visit them and I have to rely on them visiting me. I’m not working which leaves us with less money and to be completely honest-struggling to pay rent. I have been job searching but I have had no luck. I feel like me and my husband haven’t been able to get along for a whole day. He doesn’t try to even do foreplay with me. He just comes at it and says he wants sex and just tried to get down to it fast. I’m the person to text everyone and I get blown off all the time and I try to talk about my problems and my friends don’t really respond with much more than go to therapy or that’s a lot. So much of me just doesn’t want to live anymore. I don’t want to wake up knowing how the day is going to go and feel the ways I do. Going through post partum and pregnancy and not driving I feel like I don’t control anything. The main reason I haven’t is because I’m pregnant. I feel like my daughter would do much better without me and so would my fiancé. I am not happy and I haven’t been and it’s three months until I give birth and I want to possibly do it after I give birth. I think about it everyday.

Now to pay all the bills I'll have just enough minus groceries. I'm not from the area I live in so I hardly have friends and no family. Of course I have options but I don't feel I have the energy to take them. I gave my cousin my gun as a red herring that I wouldn't kill myself. The gun was from my father so I wouldn't do that to him anyway. The past few days I've considered driving home, taking melatonin, and going to sleep in my running car.

Woke up with a plan to commit suicide - decided to give myself the chance to face my problems,"My mother has been threatening suicide on me for the past weeks. Telling me in detail how she wanted to do it, and that she would have left a letter accusing me of pushing her to the edge. She furthermore refuses to seek professional help, because I am the only cause of our depression. 

For years I've functioned on what I call ""survival mode"" : work on the most important stuff, brush details or small tasks aside.

Well this nonchalant behavior of not allocating energy to details and small tasks finally bit me in the ass this week.

- I didn't put enough effort into formatting excel files, which let down my colleague and forced him to take the workload. He resented me immensely for this. I also know he complained about me to other colleagues. 

- I put away participating in a colleague's goodbye gift and eventually forgot. All my colleagues knew about it and treated me like a pariah.

My work was the last thing I had left. If my colleagues hate me, going into work will become extremely painful. I saw no more issues to my suffering. Not to mention, I have trouble understanding social cues and creating bonds. I worry I'm not fit to live in a society, or work with colleagues.


I had an unused prescription for antidepressants, and I planned to go to my pharmacy and swallow them all.

However I put it off. I called the suicide line twice. While the discussions felt a bit superficial, they managed to convey important things : 1. Forgetting to participate in a gift will be forgiven in time as my actions speak for themselves (I am actually a very empathetic person) 2. One bad work performance on something as minor as formatting excel files will eventually get buried under the rest of my good deeds, as long as I show I learned from my mistakes and don't do the same shit.

I have a shit load of structural issues that keep putting me down. My relationship with my mother, me thinking not allocating time and energy to small tasks is efficiency, my crippling depression, me getting a debilitating anxiety attack everytime something goes bad at work, me not being able to socialize and create bonds.

I realized all of this has no relationship to work. If I keep using work as a band-aid, I'll keep getting hurt again and again. I need to tackle my structural issues.

So in the end, I didn't go to the pharmacy, even though I already had taken the prescription out of my binder. I decided that my issues were in fact solvable, and I wanted to at least give it a serious try ; not for my colleagues (these I will leave soon enough) but for myself.

This goes beyond work and colleagues, which are temporary. I want to understand why I'm living the way I do. I want to give myself some compassion, while not running away from my misshaps. I want to change, I know I can if I understand why I'm doing it, and if a professional can give me tools and advice to cope better and change behavior.

Fuck my colleagues. This goes well beyond them. They are not in my head, they can't know what I am going through, and it's ok. I want to do it for me, not for work.

Now that I have a precise goal and an actual plan to tackle my issues, a door has been reopened. I will live for me.",Successful-Car1438,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ou6zvn/woke_up_with_a_plan_to_commit_suicide_decided_to/

I’ve been trying to talk myself into it all night. I can’t handle it anymore,"My girlfriend broke up with me 2 weeks ago after what I thought were an amazing 3 years. I just turned 15 when we started dating, it feels like she’s been there forever at this point. 

I tried to hold out hope that I could fix things, and I’ve been writing letters to show her how I feel and I’ve been thinking about her a lot. 

Except today, I found out she’s got someone new. They’ve gone on dates, she’s posting about it publicly, and I don’t know how she could rip my heart out like this. How could she move on so fast? She’s been stringing me along too, telling me she still loved me after we broke up. 

The pain is unbearable. While I was sitting here in a ridiculous amount of pain she was just out to the movies. I’m not gonna delude myself anymore, I know it’s over. But I miss her so much still, I want to hold on to hope even though I know she’s not coming back. All my life I’ve been fucked over whenever I tried to trust anyone, even by my own parents. I thought it could be different this time, but it’s not. I can’t go on living like this. We always talked about the future, she’d tell me about how much she wanted to get married. 

But I guess she doesn’t give a shit about me now, and she’s got something new to replace me.

It’s been a hard week TW: SH mention,"I came home last Friday from a very difficult 13 hour shift to my boyfriend of five years in bed with another woman. I am diagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar and bpd, unmedicated as I could not afford them, and honestly lost my head. Didn’t hurt either of them but yelled and cried, asked the girl how long they had been seeing eachother and she laughed in my face before leaving. I self harmed meaning to do only a little scratch but ended up slicing down deep enough to cut my muscle in my arm. Which lead to me panicking more, called 911, instead of ambulance cops show up with guns and pointed them at me at I’m walking out of the house completely unarmed. Once in the hospital they treated me like shit, petitioned me to go to a psych facility for a few days, but only after the cops charged me with disorderly conduct for being in crisis and making a scene. All while this is happening my ex has kept in contact with me and is going back and forth from supportive and remorseful to cold.
I feel like there’s more to the story because he took days of me begging to block her and I found an earring in his bed the week before but accepted his excuse for it before this happened. 
I’m not adjusting to my meds well at all, I’ve been having horrible panic attacks worse than I ever have. I’m so empty and defeated, I feel like I’m looking at the world half asleep.

I'm tired.,"Things have felt especially shitty for me recently.

I have had eczema for 4-5 years now, but it used to just be limited to the backs of my thighs. That sucked and I got self conscious about wearing shorts. Then it started going down my legs and I couldn't shave or wax anymore. I stopped wearing shorts altogether and I recently stared getting my eczema under control. 

After that it spread to my genitals and it's disgusting (shaving or waxing irritates it and makes things worse), painful, and humiliating. There's nothing I can really do to get it completely under control, and nothing's working. That was a month ago. Now it's on my arms and most recently, my eyelids. It hurts to know that it might go on for the rest of my life and people will always think I'm gross now because I got the bad share from the gene pool. It hurts to cry and it hurts having to bottle things up in fear of causing flare ups. 

I've always been very self conscious. I'm around 5 feet tall and I weigh 116 pounds. Everyone tells me I'm fine but based off of what I've been told, I know I need to lose weight. I've lost 10 pounds so far this summer (I'm trying to keep under the radar so my parents don't find out) and my main goal for the end of the year is to get to 100 pounds and then 90. I want so badly to be tiny but my parents are all for body positivity and discourage me from trying. 

I constantly feel unwanted and unloved and it's draining. My family doesn't give me much affection or attention and I'm always lonely. I just want to feel loved and cared for and what I want the most in life is to find someone I can spend it  with. Guys never look at me. I'm unattractive. I know it for a fact. They used to dare each other to ask me out as a 'joke' and they would always say ""Please say no"" before asking. It hurts so badly. I want to start wearing makeup but I'm allergic to so many skin products that I can't use anything that's not going to be expensive. 

I've been suicidal before and have been sent to a behavioral health center a couple years back but that's because I told my family about it. Instead of listening to me, they just dumped me somewhere else so they didn't have to deal with me. I'm a burden and this time I'm not sure if I should tell them anything. My mother will just try to force religion onto me (isn't believing in God enough? Why should I pray to something we can't prove the existence of?) And my father won't react. The last time I had a major break down he laughed at me and watched. I do have a therapist, but that's not helping me because if she finds out she'll tell my family. 

I can't keep this up. I'm so tired and I haven't had much of an appetite. I'm crying again and my eyes are burning. I want to end it all but my mother says I'm selfish because of it. My father says I'm choosing to feel this way. I'm scared and I just want to disappear. What's the point of sticking around? I don't have a future ahead of me... no plans except finishing high school and moving out. My parents don't even want me to move out; they keep saying I owe them for all the years they took care of me. 

I want so badly to have someone hold me and tell me it's okay. Nobody loves me enough to do that and I just wish I could die. Why does this keep happening? I want to be happy. Why can't the world let me be happy?",clown-slide43,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ouchps/im_tired/

I know I should probably go to inpatient, but as stupid as this sounds I don't want to go and just say ""I haven't done anything, I'm just suicidal lol"" because I've tried to kill myself or have been in so many emotional crisis I shit you not some of the doctors in every hospital in my area recongizes me by face or name alone. It's embarrassing. 

This time I attempt I'm not going to chicken out or not try hard enough. If someone finds me, they find me. But if not? I finally just fucking die.

17 and on the edge because of school,"
I have struggled my entire life with mental issues. Shit really got real when I got into high school the amount of shit I had to go through was crazy and has 100% destroyed me as a person. Now, just being at home every single day sucks. I am now just trying to finish up my junior year and have my huge final test in like 4 days. I have a shit ton to study for, but I am just so burnt out and tired of trying. I can’t bring myself to continue writing my essay, I can’t keep reviewing and be disciplined. I just feel so dead inside and numb, I am so sick of this life and suffering for school. I have been taking Vyvanse and like 200 mg+ of caffeine in hopes that I will be motivated and finish. However, I am just finding that the substances: vyvsanse, alcohol, caffeine can never fix my problems and apathy for life. I am really just trying to pull through, but I feel like I just can’t. I am feeling like complete shit, because this will literally make or break my 11th grade year. 
All of my suffering and mental healt isssues created from shcool will make me feel 10x worse if I can’t even finish it with decent grades. 
I have literally sacrificed and failed at everything because I know school and getting good grades is my last hope. My whole fucking junior year and suffering will be useless if I fail. I have a major essay and a shit ton of review and I know I am failing everything. 
Everything else in my life has been sacrificed due to my mental issues and school: depression, anxiety, social ineptness, my one talent (running), my hygiene (never am able to make myself snower, teeth pretty bad for my age), any job experience/money, a car, a social life (and I can’t).

My only escape to all this bullshit is cod zombies at this point. I’m using a throwaway so nobody finds out who I am.

Its been manageable, but lately every time I think about my future and the future society expects the only way I see myself is miserable. Why suffer through that when I could just take the easy way out? Why go to college and go into debt for a career I might not even be good at? Why am I a toxic person? I think I'm alright but it seems like every relationship with someone ends up in pieces. Why bother everyone with my personality and toxicity when I could just end it? Nobody would miss me. My parents think I'm a freak. Itd be so easy just to jump. I want to talk to someone but I'm not really close enough to anybody to talk to them about this.

I'm also afraid it would extend around the house, when the purpose is just to inhale.

How should I do it? Please be specific... I just never made fire before and I'm 26.  (maybe there's the alternative to buy a generator that would produce carbon monoxide? the issue will be that I heard the machine is noisy as hell, and I don't have my own apartment).

This might be the end,"Everything in my life has gone to complete shit, I can't keep living a life like this.

The self neglect, the bottled up emotions, the workaholic lifestyle, my best friends suicide, the inability to talk to or be with my gf (the only person that ever helped me when I feel this way) and being caught up in the legal system have led me to where I am right now, with blood dripping down my arms and a feeling of emptiness I've never known to be this bad before.

“Losing” a best friend of mine and it fucking sucks,"I don’t know how many of you can relate.

Her and my family have been close since before we were born. They went through some traumatic shit together and our families were close. When we were little we hung out all the time, attended all their family BBQ’s and birthday parties and likewise, we were close friends. I even stayed over at her house one summer and it was so much fun. We were still close awhile ago. Everyday we would call and text and send each other memes. To describe her personality, she’s the quiet and nerdy type, but very sweet. 

Two months ago she got a new job, she quit her old one because the management wasn’t good or something. She started hanging out with these other people at her new job. From what I can tell they aren’t very good influences. They get high and drunk whenever they have free time, tbh they’re kinda losers and are dicks to other people, including one of her new close friends cheating on her BF with a guy from work. 

She likes these people. I guess they make her feel more alive or something. But she never texts or calls me anymore. Everytime i call her she sighs and asks me what I want. I ask her when we can hang out. She says she’ll see. Don’t hear from her for weeks.
