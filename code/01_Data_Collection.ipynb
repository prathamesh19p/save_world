We\\'re hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \\n\\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it\\'s much better to respond in public comments, at least until you\\'ve gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n###Summary###\\n\\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it\\'s unwise to trust them.** \\n\\n\\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it\\'s just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\\n\\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you\\'ll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you\\'ll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \\n\\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don\\'t give their names and callers aren\\'t allowed to request specific responders.  It\\'s much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it\\'s much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It\\'s partly about availability, but it\\'s mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \\n\\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it\\'s much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can\\'t see or police PMs.)  \\n\\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There\\'s no reason why someone who\\'s truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \\n\\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they\\'ve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone\\'s in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\\n\\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don\\'t recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.',\n",

       "     'selftext': 'ive been going to a therapist for a couple of months now I dont quite see how anything is supposed to help me feel less empty and unbelievably alone. Im not to sure what to do with my life anymore. \\n\\nI was r@ped by one of my best friends this summer. Him and i had been friends since sixth grade were both in high school now. We had a somewhat flirty relationship before but I was very clear on my intentions with the relationship. We would constantly get high and sneak out to his car id come home around 4 am sick and regretting ever going out.\\n\\nHe came by my house around 12 pm in his car, he came out of his car with weed. we sat on a hill just outside my house and he rolled blunts for us. He lit one and then gave it to me.  We both got high and after an hour or so he seemed to be calmer. I was still very out of it and he asked me if we could go inside I agreed because it was getting cold. We grabbed snacks and then went into my basement.\\n\\nI was wearing jeans and an over-sized shirt that use to be my dads. We started to listen to music and just talk. It was such a peaceful night and I was enjoying it. He wrapped his arms around me and I leaned back into him. We had cuddled before ,but never done anything sexual. I was a virgin and he as not. He wrapped his arms around my neck and put me underneath him.  I had told him jokingly that he could take my v card. He asked me about it and I remember telling him clearly that I didn\\'t want to.\\n\\nHe took of my jeans and took off my underwear. I began to cry. He put himself inside  me and it was a pain that i had  never felt before. He put me on top of him and I immediately got off and cried on his shoulder while I was still totally out of it, still feeling the effects from the weed. He then had sex with me as he covered my mouth. After this all happend he left immediately after. We never kissed, he fucked me and left without saying anything. He left me in my own basement sobbing while he ran out the back door.\\n\\nMy dad had installed security cameras on two of the outer doors exiting our house he got a notification ,and  I woke up to him and my mom in my room. I couldn\\'t walk well enough to get up and confront them so I sat on my bed looking up at them. My moms words hurt so badly when she asked me if i \"fucked\" someone in the basement. My dad looked at me with the worst expression ive ever seen. Daddy\\'s little girl loosing her virginity in his shirt. My mom sent me off to my aunts for a week. when I came back my mother took me to the doctor and it slipped that the sex wasn\\'t consensual. My mom was very upset and cried on the ride home. Im not allowed to contact the police or him. My dad wont look at me and im banned from telling him what happend because in the words of my mother it would  make matters worse.\\n\\nI feel disgusted and so unbelievably depressed. I feel like actions have no consequences. Nothing seems to real right now. Im suicidal. Im not sure how much longer I can continue. Ive decided that I dont want to tell anyone about what really happened. Nobody deserves to know. This is my first time using Reddit so im not to sure how to post or really how to use the app. Thank you if you\\'ve made it this far I appreciate the kind souls ive found my myself confiding this info in. - Liz',\n",

Have for as long as I can remember which I guess is why I started drinking all the time, doing heaps of drugs, and cutting myself. Did it help? No, not really. But it did pass the time. Made me feel like I could see myself just waiting to die rather than feeling like I was always a month or two away from killing myself.\\n\\nBut now I’ve stopped all that shit. Haven’t done drugs for about 6 months. Haven’t self-harmed for 4. Haven’t had any alcohol for 3. Did it cause it’s all you fucking hear as an addict, shit like “you gotta stop, you’ll feel so much better!”, and “you’ll never get where you need to be while you’re doing that shit!”. And maybe it’s even true in some cases.\\n\\nThink the thing people forget is, I did that shit because I hate being alive. Suicide didn’t just feel like it was in the cards, it felt like it was the whole fucking deck. Like my next draw was it, I could delay it, but it was fucking inevitable. \\n\\nThe therapists couldn’t help. Not DBT or CBT or EMDR or fucking any of them. It was all just fucking words at the end of the day. I’d take the suggestions, journaling, meditation, breathing exercises, the fucking mindfulness and practice ‘em, I mean really try, for at least a month, but still, sweet fuck all in the results column. \\n\\nPills were the same. Antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, didn’t fucking matter. When through dozens and dozens of the fucking things. None of them did anything, not a fucking thing. Not even one pesky fucking side effects. Zilch.  \\n\\nSo then I started self-medicating. Maybe it’s just cause I was so fucking numb all the time I just couldn’t tell how much I was suffering but I felt better. At least in ways. Didn’t have relationships to ruin, and for sure didn’t start new ones, but I could at least tolerate talking to people. Could tolerate being at work, can’t do that normally. Shame it’s hard to go unnoticed doing that shit at work though so I still couldn’t *hold* a job. Made a couple things better at least.\\n\\nBut then I stopped. Cause people I used to know told me I should. Only they fucked off outta my life and I relapsed. Then I stopped again cause those fucking people have instilled their fucking ideas in my head now and I can’t escape the fucking guilt and shame anymore and addiction is basically ruined for me. Thanks, fuckers.\\n\\nBut now I’m worse than ever. The medication still doesn’t do a fucking thing. Therapy is still just fucking useless words. Everything still fucking sucks and I still think about killing myself 24/7. Still exercise everyday, eat well, try to do shit, but it doesn’t fucking help one iota. And now one of my only options, becoming an addict to numb it all away, is gone cause of the fucking guilt. \\n\\nAnd the fucking therapists and shit just pat you on the back and tell you how fucking “proud” you should be for kicking the addictions. Like it fucking matters. Like them being proud translates to you in any fucking way. Like you don’t constantly wish you could throw the guilt away and go right back to it. Like it’s made any fucking difference in your life whatso-fucking-ever. They just act like you made it through hell when in reality, you’re caught in the worst fucking hell yet. And then they dust off their fucking hands and act like the hard works all done, at least the bulk of it. But it fucking isn’t. Feels like I’ve lost ground, like I’m a few steps *before* square one now. \\n\\nI just fucking hate this shit. I don’t understand what my brain is fucking waiting for by not letting my just up and kill myself. I don’t know why the fuck I can’t do it when it’s all I wanna do, when I don’t have any fucking hope and I don’t fucking care if it’ll “get better one day”.',\n",

I feel awfully suicidal very often. I’ve told my mother, but I think because of my age she hasn’t been taking it seriously. I haven’t been given a diagnosis yet, and haven’t had much help. I only have 1 friend I fully feel comfortable sharing stuff with, but because they live on the other side of the world, and are very busy, it’s hard to talk with them that often. Every day I feel depressed at least once, sometimes it’s light but on days like today it’s VERY heavy. All I’m ever told are the basic “It gets better!” “Cheer up!” “Let it go”. They’re all meaningless. I also have a lot of problems with my dad. It’s all just too much. Im too young, I just want it to end. I want to disappear. Run away, hide in a pothole, something. Anything. To let me feel peace. I haven’t for so long. Please let me know if you need anything like information or anything.\\n\\n*EDIT*: \\nMy crush told me she liked me as a truth or dare and I said yes.

The past year has been the hardest as well. I feel awfully suicidal very often. I’ve told my mother, but I think because of my age she hasn’t been taking it seriously. I haven’t been given a diagnosis yet, and haven’t had much help. I only have 1 friend I fully feel comfortable sharing stuff with, but because they live on the other side of the world, and are very busy, it’s hard to talk with them that often. Every day I feel depressed at least once, sometimes it’s light but on days like today it’s VERY heavy. All I’m ever told are the basic “It gets better!” “Cheer up!” “Let it go”. They’re all meaningless. I also have a lot of problems with my dad. It’s all just too much. Im too young, I just want it to end. I want to disappear. Run away, hide in a pothole, something. Anything. To let me feel peace. I haven’t for so long. Please let me know if you need anything like information or anything.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT&lt;/em&gt;: \\nMy crush told me she liked me as a truth or dare and I said yes. I had to pull the “I was joking too!”. Nothing will ever be fixed. Really, that was my final straw. I don’t know what I’ll do now&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': \"I'm a junior in high school and Ive always academically challenged myself. However when quarantine hit, during second semester I just fell apart. Then during summer I had to do a 6 week summer program, an internship, and did precalc and sat practice during the summer and I just lost it, I half heartedly did everything. I dropped precalc didn't do any sat practice the internship I bullshitted and I was the weak link in the summer program. Had 2 days to rest until school and I'm on my 2nd week and I'm barely getting homework done. Last sem i got 2 B's, and one of the Bs detrimented by mental health so much I basicslly cried the first two days of school  (89.1). I've been doing everything so slowly, I'm literally ALWAYS zoned out, feel restless,can't focus on anything, my mind constantly just races. My friend of 7 yrs (longest friend) also ghosted me and left for another friend group. I constantly do passive suicidal ideation, I gained 15 pounds, etc. I legitimately can't accomplish anything I set my mind to, I give up immediately when things go wrong. I just feel so exhausted,my mind feels so exhausted. My eyes are watering when I'm typing this and I feel like I have no support and I feel like days are just passing by and they're all just conjoined and life doesn't even feel real and I just feel like not existing. I'm existing through my thoughts and I'm always just worrying. I can't stop. I genuinely feel like I'm going to be this drained out for the rest of my life I can't do anything. Simple things take so long to do even laying down stressed me out. I'm bullshitting the most important year in high school and it's worrying me cus I've always been academically competitive and now I'm giving up in the most essential time and it's such an abrupt change and I have no one to talk to. I have 3 other friends and we only talk for 35 min during lunch and we don't talk after that. I just wish I could relax and I just want to escape somewhere I just want to leave this place I'm in. I don't think I can ever be happy in my life my mind always makes even good days bad and I'm so privileged I literally live in the bay area and I'm complaining and I wish I could trade places with someone who would use it to their full potential and I genuinely can't get anything done unless it's due in a few minutes and I feel like I'm stuck in time and I can't move and I'm trying to break these walls but they don't budge. I don't know I hate me but i talk to myself at least 1 hr a day bc that's the only genuine social interaction I get and I just wish I could get out of this cycle I feel so alone and I hate myself thanks for listening to my ted talk just wanted to get this out of my mind :)\",\n",

       "     'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a junior in high school and Ive always academically challenged myself. However when quarantine hit, during second semester I just fell apart. Then during summer I had to do a 6 week summer program, an internship, and did precalc and sat practice during the summer and I just lost it, I half heartedly did everything. I dropped precalc didn&amp;#39;t do any sat practice the internship I bullshitted and I was the weak link in the summer program. Had 2 days to rest until school and I&amp;#39;m on my 2nd week and I&amp;#39;m barely getting homework done. Last sem i got 2 B&amp;#39;s, and one of the Bs detrimented by mental health so much I basicslly cried the first two days of school  (89.1). I&amp;#39;ve been doing everything so slowly, I&amp;#39;m literally ALWAYS zoned out, feel restless,can&amp;#39;t focus on anything, my mind constantly just races. My friend of 7 yrs (longest friend) also ghosted me and left for another friend group. I constantly do passive suicidal ideation, I gained 15 pounds, etc. I legitimately can&amp;#39;t accomplish anything I set my mind to, I give up immediately when things go wrong. I just feel so exhausted,my mind feels so exhausted. My eyes are watering when I&amp;#39;m typing this and I feel like I have no support and I feel like days are just passing by and they&amp;#39;re all just conjoined and life doesn&amp;#39;t even feel real and I just feel like not existing. I&amp;#39;m existing through my thoughts and I&amp;#39;m always just worrying. I can&amp;#39;t stop. I genuinely feel like I&amp;#39;m going to be this drained out for the rest of my life I can&amp;#39;t do anything. Simple things take so long to do even laying down stressed me out. I&amp;#39;m bullshitting the most important year in high school and it&amp;#39;s worrying me cus I&amp;#39;ve always been academically competitive and now I&amp;#39;m giving up in the most essential time and it&amp;#39;s such an abrupt change and I have no one to talk to. I have 3 other friends and we only talk for 35 min during lunch and we don&amp;#39;t talk after that. I just wish I could relax and I just want to escape somewhere I just want to leave this place I&amp;#39;m in. I don&amp;#39;t think I can ever be happy in my life my mind always makes even good days bad and I&amp;#39;m so privileged I literally live in the bay area and I&amp;#39;m complaining and I wish I could trade places with someone who would use it to their full potential and I genuinely can&amp;#39;t get anything done unless it&amp;#39;s due in a few minutes and I feel like I&amp;#39;m stuck in time and I can&amp;#39;t move and I&amp;#39;m trying to break these walls but they don&amp;#39;t budge. I don&amp;#39;t know I hate me but i talk to myself at least 1 hr a day bc that&amp;#39;s the only genuine social interaction I get and I just wish I could get out of this cycle I feel so alone and I hate myself thanks for listening to my ted talk just wanted to get this out of my mind :)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I didn&amp;#39;t want any of this hurt and pain. I&amp;#39;m trying my hardest to stay busy and talk with friends. But as soon as I&amp;#39;m alone it all goes dark and I keep crying and I just can&amp;#39;t take it. I didn&amp;#39;t ask for any of this. I&amp;#39;ve been a huge mess. I just want someone to hold me, I just want to be loved again and feel safe. It hurts so bad.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You never know when it&amp;#39;s the last time you&amp;#39;ll ever get to hold them and that scares me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Now I just feel empty and dead inside. \\n\\nI can’t talk to anyone about this. My head is a mess. It’s been almost 4 years but I feel like I’m mourning all over again. \\n\\nDid she plan it? What pills did she take? If I had called the ambulance faster, would she have survived? Why didn’t anyone tell me the truth? \\n\\nThe worst part is the fact that I’m just going to have to pretend this never happened and continue my life as normal.

On the 4th of February 2018, she committed suicide. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That’s what I witnessed. A suicide. My mother’s suicide. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Immediately after I found out, I cried for about an hour. Now I just feel empty and dead inside. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can’t talk to anyone about this. My head is a mess. It’s been almost 4 years but I feel like I’m mourning all over again. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Did she plan it? What pills did she take? If I had called the ambulance faster, would she have survived? Why didn’t anyone tell me the truth? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The worst part is the fact that I’m just going to have to pretend this never happened and continue my life as normal. The same way I returned to school 3 days after the death. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No wonder I’m so fucked up in the head. I’m aware this is rant-y and probably doesn’t even make sense. But I literally have no idea how to process this. So if you’ve read this, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n###Summary###\\n\\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it\\'s unwise to trust them.** \\n\\n\\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it\\'s just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\\n\\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you\\'ll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you\\'ll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \\n\\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don\\'t give their names and callers aren\\'t allowed to request specific responders.  It\\'s much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it\\'s much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It\\'s partly about availability, but it\\'s mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \\n\\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it\\'s much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can\\'t see or police PMs.)  \\n\\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There\\'s no reason why someone who\\'s truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \\n\\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they\\'ve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone\\'s in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\\n\\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don\\'t recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.',\n",
