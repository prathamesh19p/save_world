    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In week four we've learned about a few different classifiers. In week five we'll learn about webscraping, APIs, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Now we're going to put those skills to the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "For project 3, your goal is two-fold:\n",
    "1. Using Reddit's API, you'll collect posts from two subreddits of your choosing.\n",
    "2. You'll then use NLP to train a classifier on which subreddit a given post came from. This is a binary classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About the API\n",
    "\n",
    "Reddit's API is fairly straightforward. For example, if I want the posts from [`/r/boardgames`](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames), all I have to do is add `.json` to the end of the url: https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames.json\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you get started, we have a primer video on how to use Reddit's API: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Y3ZE26Ciuk\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gather and prepare your data using the `requests` library.\n",
    "- **Create and compare two models**. One of these must be a Bayes classifier, however the other can be a classifier of your choosing: logistic regression, KNN, SVM, etc.\n",
    "- A Jupyter Notebook with your analysis for a peer audience of data scientists.\n",
    "- An executive summary of the results you found.\n",
    "- A short presentation outlining your process and findings for a semi-technical audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro Tip 1:** You can find a good example executive summary [here](https://www.proposify.biz/blog/executive-summary).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro Tip 2:** Reddit will give you 25 posts **per request**. To get enough data, you'll need to hit Reddit's API **repeatedly** (most likely in a `for` loop). _Be sure to use the `time.sleep()` function at the end of your loop to allow for a break in between requests. **THIS IS CRUCIAL**_\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro tip 3:** The API will cap you at 1,000 posts for each subreddit (assuming the subreddit has that many posts).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro tip 4:** At the end of each loop, be sure to save the results from your scrape as a `csv`: JSON from Reddit > Pandas DataFrame > CSV. That way, if something goes wrong in your loop, you won't lose all your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Necessary Deliverables / Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code and executive summary must be in a clearly commented Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "- You must submit your slide deck.\n",
    "- Materials must be submitted by **9:00 AM on Friday, Oct 25th**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rubric\n",
    "Your local instructor will evaluate your project (for the most part) using the following criteria.  You should make sure that you consider and/or follow most if not all of the considerations/recommendations outlined below **while** working through your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Project 3 the evaluation categories are as follows:<br>\n",

    "### Why we choose this project for you?\n",
    "This project covers three of the biggest concepts we cover in the class: Classification Modeling, Natural Language Processing and Data Wrangling/Acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1 of the project focuses on **Data wrangling/gathering/acquisition**. This is a very important skill as not all the data you will need will be in clean CSVs or a single table in SQL.  There is a good chance that wherever you land you will have to gather some data from some unstructured/semi-structured sources; when possible, requesting information from an API, but often scraping it because they don't have an API (or it's terribly documented).\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2 of the project focuses on **Natural Language Processing** and converting standard text data (like Titles and Comments) into a format that allows us to analyze it and use it in modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 3 of the project focuses on **Classification Modeling**.  Given that project 2 was a regression focused problem, we needed to give you a classification focused problem to practice the various models, means of assessment and preprocessing associated with classification.   \n"

       " 'selftext': 'We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \\n\\nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We\\'re hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \\n\\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it\\'s much better to respond in public comments, at least until you\\'ve gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n###Summary###\\n\\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it\\'s unwise to trust them.** \\n\\n\\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it\\'s just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\\n\\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you\\'ll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you\\'ll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \\n\\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don\\'t give their names and callers aren\\'t allowed to request specific responders.  It\\'s much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it\\'s much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It\\'s partly about availability, but it\\'s mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \\n\\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it\\'s much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can\\'t see or police PMs.)  \\n\\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There\\'s no reason why someone who\\'s truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \\n\\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they\\'ve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone\\'s in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\\n\\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don\\'t recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.',\n",
